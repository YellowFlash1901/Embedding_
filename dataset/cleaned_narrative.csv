17,Disclosure verification of debt,"I 'm a member of the XXXX and have been activated on title XXXX orders for XXXX duty of various time lengths in the last couple of years. My civilian job has been very helpful and has worked well with me and my family with the transitions, up until this point, that is. The attached documentation is in chronological order and I will try to explain it in this letter in the same manner. 
The first letter I received was dated XXXX XXXX XXXX and it is telling me I have a debit of {$1700.00} in unpaid health insurance. I elected to pay for and maintain my civilian coverage while on XXXX XXXX to allow my family to keep our same providers and use my military insurance as secondary coverage. It states in the letter that my payments are scheduled to be taken out of my check and that I would maintain the pretax benefit with that. I elected to let that procedure take place as outlined in the letter. I was back at the XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX ; I then went on XXXX XXXX for two more weeks from XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then returned to the XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX and stayed there until I was activated on the orders that I am on now ; XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
In XXXX XXXX I received the attached letter from the Treasury Dept. that stated I owed {$660.00} and listed a website and a telephone number. The website seemed suspect to me and was asking for all my personal information, so I called the phone number on the letter and left messages there, with no response. The letter also stated on the top my debit was {$660.00}, but at the bottom payment coupon it says I owe {$850.00}. I contacted my supervisor at the XXXX and he contacted XXXX of the XXXX personnel that are located in XXXX. They both advised me to wait until they checked it out to make sure it was legitimate. 
Next, I received a phone call on my cell phone from Pioneer Credit Recovery Inc. asking if I was XXXX XXXX, what was my birthdate, address and last XXXX of my SS. Of course I was very wary of answering, but then he told me my last XXXX! He wanted me to send them a copy of my orders and I told him the XXXX had copies of my orders and if they sent him to me, they can give him copies of my orders. This is what rekindled my efforts at finding out what is going on, so I contacted my XXXX Supervisor, and the XXXX person. XXXX sent me the information attached dated XXXX XXXX that outlined my medical insurance payments and what is still due. On page XXXX it states I owe a principle of {$630.00}, interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00}. After I obtained this information I mailed a {$500.00} check to the XXXX in XXXX XXXX with the attached XXXX XXXX XXXX letter. I have also attached an image of the cancelled check for {$500.00}. I will mail them the remaining amount when I find out if I am liable for the full amount. This brings me to XXXX of my questions ; Am I responsible for the interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00} or does the XXXX allow for these charges to be waived because they were incurred while I was on military duty and they are trying to be collected while I am again on military duty?

I repeated numerous times that I would consider their service again once I was out of contract with XXXX and they stated they would n't charge me anything for the equipment. I told them I would immediately send the equipment back if I would be charged any kind of fees. This went on for months without a problem. They assured me that I would n't be charged. Then I started getting miniature charges of {$6.00} here or there. I told them I would send the equipment back and they kept billing me for "" maintenance '' fees on the account even though I was no longer under contract for TV service.

I owe them nothing, but they have turned it over to a collection agency called Stellar Recovery Inc .",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,2216997
26,Communication tactics,"In XXXX 2015 I received a collections notice from "" Bay Area Credit Service '' - I had no idea what it was for so I sent a FAX requesting more information, such as to whom the money was owed and for what ... .. I then set it aside to await a response and if none received intended to turn it over to the police as mail "" phishing scam ''. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I had still received no response so I decided to attempt calling them before reporting it to the police. It turns out that the debt was a valid medical debt however, the provider failed to send me a bill and in speaking with the original service provider ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, CA ), it turns out they had the secondary insurance information all along and simply failed to bill them either. Additionally, they advised that they had a different address but this has been the address for years and was also the address where the service was provided. The first person I spoke with said they attempted phone contact but they did not and when I mentioned that to the supervisor, she did not indicate that any attempt to contact by telephone was made. The hospital and physicians who provided treatment related to this injury all have the correct information and were all paid in full within weeks of service. 
My concern is that this type of business practice damages a person 's credit - especially when the 'debtor ' would have been and still is more than willing and able to pay any uncovered expenses. 
After two hours of phone calls and speaking with a supervisor, I was told they would forward the information to the collection agency and request that it not be reported to credit agencies. I explained that I was comfortable sharing any more information with any collection agency and again requested that they pull it out of collections, bill the secondary insurance and then, if any monies were owed, bill me for the remainder. 
The supervisor at XXXX XXXX XXXX was unfamiliar with the procedure to pull back any accounts sold to collections but will look into it and phone me back in two days. Even if I am successful in pressuring them to do the right thing, it is clear that correcting mistakes is not a standard policy or practice for this provider. 
Is there a law in place protecting people from such damaging business practices? if not, there should be. I did read that the collections agency is required to give you the original provider 's information such as the name and contact information and that was not done upon receipt of my FAXED inquiry in XXXX 2015 and when I spoke with them today, they gave me the name but refused to give me the contact information for the provider ( I found it myself online ). 
Additionally, the practice of 'selling ' accounts due at a reduced rate when they are in fact able to collect through standard billing methods, only serves to further increase the already inflated cost of medical care - making it increasingly difficult for average citizens to obtain and pay for needed medical care.",Company can't verify or dispute the facts in the complaint,1676389
27,Disclosure verification of debt,"On XXXX XXXX, 2017, I had to call the XXXX County Toll Authority because I was having trouble retrieving my account online. I spoke with XXXX who informed me that I have a {$40.00} credit in my account, by the XXXX tag in my car had been inactivated and I now have toll violations totaling over {$200.00}. I asked XXXX why I was never informed about the violations and she said the two notifications they sent out came back. Come to find out, they had my apartment number incomplete ; which does n't make sense because I 've received correspondence to my address from the Toll Authority before. I also verified with XXXX they had my correct email on file and asked her why was n't I notified via email when they saw the mail had gotten returned. XXXX could n't give me a reason, but apologized for the mix up and said she would waive the administrative fees that had accrued since I was n't properly notified. However, there were XXXX violations that they already invoiced and sent over to a third party collector : Lineberger, Goggin, Blair and Sampson. XXXX told me she could n't waive the collector 's fees and I would have to contact them directly to discuss that. I spoke with XXXX at the collector 's office and told her that I was never notified of the debt I wanted to speak to someone about the fees being waived since due diligence was n't done. Just like the XXXX County Toll Authority, XXXX read my address and the apartment number was incomplete. XXXX said they get all their information from the Toll Authority who gets their information from the DMV. I told XXXX that I 've received documents from the Toll Authority before at my current address and my address is also reflected on my license ( so the DMV would have the correct information as well ). I informed XXXX that because of their mistake, the Toll Authority was going to waive their fees and I would just have to pay the toll amounts. XXXX advised me to fax proof of the fee waiver from the Toll Authority to XXXX, attn : XXXX and someone will review the information to determine if the fees from the collector should be waived as well. I called the XXXX County Toll Authority back and spoke with XXXX at XXXX, who said they do n't provide physical papers to the collector because the collector can see all of the notes in the system. XXXX documented my account that the Toll Authority was waiving their fees and told me to call the collector back and tell them they can find the documentation they need in the notes. I called the collector back at XXXX and spoke with XXXX , who transferred me to the XXXX branch by mistake. I called the collector back again at XXXX and spoke with XXXX , who then transferred me to XXXX XXXX the original rep I had spoken with ). I told XXXX what the representative from the Toll Authority told me and she said they ca n't take off the fees. I then requested to speak with a supervisor or someone who is authorized to exercise discretion about their collection fees and she transferred me to XXXX XXXX ; I left XXXX XXXX a voicemail requesting a call back at XXXX. It 's been a week and I still have n't heard back from XXXX XXXX or anyone at the collection agency. My issue is that I was n't aware of the toll violations because I thought my XXXX tag was working and was never notified by anyone, about the violations. I should n't have to pay a fee for something I was n't informed about ( especially when they had other ways to contact me : email, phone ) and therefore, never had a chance to dispute the debt ; Which is a violation of my consumer right. I have already paid the tolls that were owed, but I 'm not able to pay the XXXX that were invoiced because the amount includes the collector 's fees, which I feel I should n't have to pay. The collector did not do their part in contacting me and should n't be able to charge a fee for a service that was n't provided.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,2280995

I called I C Systems today and was then told about the debt. They claimed to have sent notice of collections to a previous post office box that I had in Arizona. However, ALL of the information on my credit report is correct. Therefore, if they wanted to contact me about this, my current address is listed on all XXXX bureaus. They could 've also called me, because my current phone number is on all three reports as well. 

Instead of conducting business the correct way, they went ahead and placed this on my report without properly contacting me and giving me a chance to dispute this. This is unacceptable. My score has dropped XXXX points because of this. 

Furthermore, the statute of limitations is up for this debt. And they are still trying to collect anyway KNOWING that the statute of limitations is 7 years for this type of debt. Just pitiful. 

I have sent I C Systems an email letting them know that I am reporting them to the CFPB. Had I not seen this on my credit report, it would 've SAT there. I 've worked entirely TOOOOOOO hard to restore my credit and will continue to work to keep it secure.

34,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"The XXXX companies I am writing about have been relentless and dishonest in attempting to collect from me credit card debts that were generated during the XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX economic meltdown. That is when the clock started. According to the statute of limitations in California where I reside, these debts are past the statute of limitations period of four years. I was informed on Wednesday that one of these companies has obtained a judgment against me and will begin to garnish my wages effective XX/XX/XXXX, defying the laws of the state that clearly spell out that debt that is older than 4 years old can not be collected. In addition, this particular debt collection firm has filed suit against me ( documents enclosed ) These aggressive debt collectors have made it a mission to enforce debts that are barred by the statute of limitations. In good faith I negotiated with XXXX of the XXXX debt collecting companies a few years ago and I have been paying down this debt slowly. The other XXXX companies have been incessant in their continued pursuit. These are all open credit accounts debts and the debt collectors know that these debts are old and past the statute of limitations. They still proceeded to sue me. Now my professional reputation within the company I work for is very much negatively impacted, perhaps irreversibly. I have no idea what impact this wage garnishment issue will have on my future advancement chances and income earning potential. The imposed wage garnishment sums are so outlandish that I can not possibly stay financially viable ; I will crash. The XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX meltdown had terrible financial repercussions on my family and I. When people around me were declaring Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, I stuck it out and fought back in order to pay back loans. My house went into foreclosure three times and three times I saved it from this fate by providing mountains of bank-requested documentation, many times the day before the house went to auction. I am very proud of having achieved this. Unfortunately some of my debts went without recourse and I lamentably could not pay them back. I achieved new and promising employment XX/XX/XXXX and I was looking forward to a productive and contributory career advancement and now this. I find it appalling that the courts would allow for a lawsuit of this nature, in full knowledge that the cases fall outside of this state 's statute of limitations. My situation now is dire. After having fought back from the precipice more than once, I am besieged by an unlawful and unscrupulous turn of events. Mind you ; I successfully came back from the meltdown while dealing with both my mother and father 's illnesses and subsequent passing. I took care of them every day after work for four years. Would not have done it any other way. So kind folks, an act of God brought me to your website. Your mission statement and goals are so worthy I can not begin to express my sentiments. Thank God that a group like yours exists. Now, I ask for help. I am staring at a life ending on such a false note.

35,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"Just received a letter from XXXX Service collecting for a local hospital. Debt is for a person with almost the same mane ( person that owes debt has different middle initial and living at a different address ). Also, some of the hospital visits are for a period when I was out of the country working for a company in XXXX XXXX. Just notified via mail. Individual is XXXX years younger than myself and has had trouble with the law in the past XXXX previous debt/restitution )",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,1371243
36,False statements or representation,"This began when I subscribed to XXXX XXXX internet service. 
In my initial contact with XXXX XXXX there representative told me in order for them to supply internet service I would need modem. The rep gave me a precise description of the modem. I found and purchased that exact modem. 
However, when the installer arrived to do the install he looked at the modem and said that is the wrong modem and I can not connect your service with that modem. I explained to him that their rep told me to buy that modem and showed him my notes with the reps name and contact information. He said, OH, they do n't know what they 're talking about, and went on to tell me which modem I needed, and I could order it from XXXX which I did. At that point I had over {$250.00} spent on Modems and they made no offer to cover my costs on the wrong modem I had purchased per their reps instruction. 

So the installer hooked up the service with the which worked for about 2 months and then it started to go down every few days. About XXXX or XXXX times they were able to get it working again. The next time it went down however they were not able to get it working again. They said that they would need to come out and go inside my house and see what was wrong with my phone lines and that it would be a minimum charge of {$250.00} and could be more, perhaps even {$500.00} or more depending on what they found. I asked them if I paid there fee for coming out and doing what ever they were going to do if they would guarantee that I would then have reliable service. They said they could make no such guarantee. I also explained to them that my phone worked fine. I checked with my phone company to see if there could be something wrong with my phone lines considering the fact that my phone worked fine. The phone company said that would not be the case if my phone was working fine. I called back to XXXX XXXX and told them the phone company said my phone lines were fine and to please restore my service. I made several more calls to XXXX XXXX over the next couple months and continued for that time to pay their bill even though I had no service. On my last call I told them that they were in breach of the contract because they failed to provide the service I had been paying for, and that I would stop paying their bill if they did not restore my service. They said again that my phone lines had to be the problem and they would come out and try to fix the lines for the minimum charge of {$250.00}. I said I was not willing to risk another {$250.00} and perhaps more on the basis of what I had found out from the phone company and that they would not guarantee I would have reliable service even if I paid their additional charges. I told them to cancel the service and to stop billing me because I was not going to pay a bill for non existent service. So I stopped paying the bill because I had no service but they continued to bill me for another 4 months. They then sent me to collections for that additional 4 months of service which I did not get, just as I had not received the last 3 months of service which I had paid for. So the net result is that I paid over {$250.00} for XXXX modems which are useless to me, I paid for XXXX months of service and received less that 3 months service. So altogether I paid {$250.00} for modems, about {$180.00} for XXXX months of service, and I now have a collection on my credit report that is negatively affecting my credit score such that the mortgage I am applying for is going to cost thousands of dollars more due to this collection showing on my credit report for {$120.00}. In reality XXXX actually owes me money. 
To make matters even worse the collection appears on my credit report as an XX/XX/XXXX occurrence, when in fact this all took place in XX/XX/XXXX.

I asked to speak with a manager and was once again hung up on. I have pulled a my credit report and its reflecting the charge off was XXXX.

43,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"XXXX of the loans in question were originated by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, acquired by XXXX XXXX in a merger. XXXX XXXX decided not to renegotiate the balloon loan for our home when it matured. Additionally, they cross defaulted the other loans. All bills were paid monthly, and we had great payment history. The properties were impossible to refinance because of the economic downturn and reduced property values. XXXX XXXX was paid approximately XXXX dollars a month for these loans, which did not include escrow. The bank was going after our home and lively hood that generated the funds to pay them. 
On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, represented by XXXX XXXX of Weinstock , Friedman & Friedman, sought and were awarded a judgement by confession in the US District Court in XXXX, MD, on our home where we resided in XXXX County, MD. This action was a violation of Maryland Consumer Protection Law, which prohibits confessed judgement on principal residences. We only learned of the judgement against us in XXXX XXXX, when we were forced to seek new legal representation. 
This action was precipitated by a promissory note which was misrepresented to me as a rate renegotiation, cited incorrect addresses, modified the original note to include the confessed judgement clause and gave us two months to pay {$320000.00}. Previously, the bank had filed for confessed judgement in XXXX County Circuit Court. The bank had been made aware of the illegal nature of the use of confessed judgement on a non-commercial real estate transaction. The bank voluntarily withdrew the judgement. 
We were served with a Motion for Discovery which had a fictitious date, as there was no Thursday, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
We were then served a Show Cause Order for Contempt which was withdrawn by the bank as we had reached a global resolution of {$300000.00}. All properties, including our business, were listed for sale. Our home went under contract XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX made it very difficult to settle, rescheduling several times, finally releasing the lien for settlement in XXXX of XXXX. Additionally, the sale of the second property to go under contract was finally aborted by the buyers who could no longer wait for the bank 's predatory practices and disregard for all parties involved. The bank is making it impossible to hold up our end of the global resolution by not releasing the property liens for sale. A second family went under contract for this property in XXXX of XXXX. The settlement was rescheduled several times before closing on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Two days later, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the sale was cancelled. XXXX claimed fraudulent documents were presented. All funds were redacted, our accounts frozen, the new home owners were forced to leave the home they paid for and begun to renovate. Homeland Title Company, in XXXX XXXX MD, paid XXXX Bank as the lien releases stipulated. The same couple would still like to purchase the home. However, XXXX refuses to honor the global resolution that was put in place XX/XX/XXXX. 
It appears that they are trying to get out of the global resolution. Each time we have the ability to pay them a substantial sum of money, they pull back and try another angle of attack. Presently, they are trying to foreclose on our business, before letting the property under contract settle. We suspect they would let us settle promptly if they had a successful foreclosure, because we would be left with nothing. 
I placed a call to the Maryland Attorney General and was strongly advised to file a grievance with the CFBP as Weinstock, Friedman & Friedman and XXXX XXXX violated Maryland law misrepresenting our home loan as a commercial loan product, defrauding the court into a confessed judgement.

48,Disclosure verification of debt,"On or about XXXX/XXXX/2015 I contacted National Credit Systems Inc. and spoke with XXXX XXXX at XXXX Ext. XXXX concerning XXXX or XXXX debts of the same account that appeared on XXXX public credit reports. I questioned the validity of the debts and the amounts owed. XXXX XXXX PROMISED to mail, to my home address which I provided during the conversation, an official document detailing the amounts owed, the original creditor and a statement guaranteeing that the debt amount would be updated on XXXX credit reports if I paid in full. XXXX XXXX explained that this was an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained would be used for that purpose. I was told the document would be mailed within a few days. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I viewed XXXX public credit reports and noted that the last reported date had been changed from XXXX/XXXX/2011 to XXXX/XXXX/2015. Instead of providing me with an official document or notice that the debt was owed, National Credit Systems Inc. updated their data with XXXX credit reporting agencies as an malicious attempt to place negative data on my credit report for an additional 7 years. The original negative information was scheduled for deletion approximately less than 1 year from the date that I called them to resolve the matter. I have contacted the original creditor prior to contacting National Credit Systems Inc. and was told that they no longer own the debt. My contract is with the original creditor, XXXX. I have no contract with National Credit Systems Inc. and they refuse to provide with any documentation to support their claim of ownership or purchase of the debt. In good faith I was attempting to resolve this matter. I provided my name, address, SSN, date of birth, employer, and both cell phone and home telephone numbers. 

The debt itself is misleading as it appears on XXXX public credit reports. It is documented as owing {$500.00} and then {$3600.00}. There is a third entry showing an amount owed of {$4100.00}. Per XXXX XXXX of National Credit Systems Inc., the full amount owed is actually {$4100.00}. My interpretation based on the manner the debt ( s ) are documented is that I owe someone, a total of {$8200.00}. In my opinion, considering the amount that this collection agency claims I owe them for debt that they intercepted from the original creditor, a letter or formal communication of some sort is not an unreasonable request. If I request an email or regular mail statement in an attempt to pay a debt, there is no reason for the creditor to penalize me and ruin my credit for an additional 7 years. I called them. According to XXXX XXXX, "" we had no way to contact you and the debt would have disappeared within months ''. The tactics used by National Credit Systems Inc. appear to be malicious and unfair in nature in terms of making promises and not following through as well as and most importantly not providing PROOF and descriptions identifying themselves as the actual debt collector and owner. If I had paid in full National Credit Systems Inc. on or about XXXX/XXXX/2015, there would not have been any guarantee that at a later date the original creditor or some other collection agency would not have contacted me claiming ownership of the same debt and demanding payment, therefore starting the process over again.",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,1568750

Despite several attempts to get an itemized list from the apartment complex which Hunter Warfield claims to represent for the charges we are supposed to owe, no list has been forthcoming.

Two years later, I joined the XXXX XXXX and had my father return the leased Cobalt at the appropriate time and place. My father did just that. Learning that the Cobalt was delivered on time is where the story ended for me. However, in XXXX, Synergetic Communications ( Syncom ) contacted me in a harassing manner demanding that I owed {$2300.00} for the Chevrolet Cobalt. There was no additional information provided, but I quickly forwarded the information on to my father regardless to see if he could shed some light on where this "" debt '' may be derived from. My father reported back to me that he had spoken with Synergetic Communications, and that they told him that they would take care of the accounting error. This is where the story starts to effect me. 

XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was contacted by Synergetic Communications again in regards to this debt of which there is no explanation. Additionally, this is eight years after the vehicle was returned and XXXX has since gone out of business. XXXX has merged with XXXX XXXX, but XXXX XXXX refuses to assist me with this issue. They have told me that "" our ( XXXX XXXX ) third party collection agency ( Synergetic Communications ) is handling this account, and there is nothing they can do to help me delete this debt from my record. '' After repeatedly trying to work this misunderstanding out with Synergetic Communications, I was told by the collections agency that "" there is nothing we ( Synergetic Communications ) can do because we report directly to Ally Financial. We do not even have the authority to report to the credit bureaus. We report directly to XXXX XXXX. '' I have recently looked into my credit report, and I was shocked to see that there is a Charge Off from XXXX of {$2300.00}. This account was taken care of many years ago. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX has no information for me in their system. The only information XXXX XXXX has at this point on my supposed account is what I had personally given them when I opened a complaint regarding this debt. 

Bottom line : Before filing this complaint with CFPB, I have attempted to have this debt expunged from my record by explaining to both Syncom and XXXX XXXX that this is debt is the result of an accounting error made eight years after the vehicle was leased ( paid in full ). Both parties refuse to help me, they both continue to advise me that I must speak to the other to get this resolved, and neither of their management representatives has offered any clarity on this matter. 

I have read other consumer complaints regarding XXXX XXXX and Synergetic Communications. It seems as though I am not alone in my experience of the unethical business practices these XXXX companies engage in to make a buck. My credit worthiness has suffered tremendously as a result of this Charge Off that was reported to the credit bureaus. I did not accrue this debt. If I am unable to resolve this issue with the help of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am prepared to pursue this matter with an attorney because of personal integrity as well as holding these XXXX companies to decent ethical standards. 

Note : As I mentioned, I gave XXXX quite a bit of information when I opened a complaint with them regarding this account.

82,False statements or representation,"My name is XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Virginia. My phone is XXXX or XXXX. This all started when I received a letter in the mail from Delta Management XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were attempting to collect on my XXXX defaulted student loans. My loans had defaulted due to the fact that I had been in an accident with my XXXX causing me to be out of work because I was recovering from my injuries for several months. At the time, I was an XXXX. I was no longer able to work for myself, so I lost my XXXX. During this time, my wife divorced me because I was n't making enough money for her. I had to sell our home and move because she wanted the money and then I had child support payments for XXXX children as well. I had completely lost everything that I loved and I had very little money. I also lost my car. I had to file bankruptcy and try to get back on my feet. I do apologize that I allowed my loans to go into default, but I tried to reach out for help with no avail. When the letter came from Delta Management, I called and asked how I could get my XXXX loans out of default XX/XX/XXXX. The Delta Management rep told me that I had to agree to have my payments automatically deducted from my paycheck and that after 6 months of consistent payments they will take my XXXX loans out of default. So, I agreed and also I agreed to pay 4 payments each month instead of 1 payment in the hopes that I would decrease my balance owed quicker and show my willingness to pay. However, although I have been paying voluntarily, consistently 4 payments each month since XX/XX/XXXX, I have not had my loans taken out of default. I am a military veteran and I am currently in the process of purchasing a home for myself and my new wife, but the loan officer pulled my credit report and showed me that my XXXX student loans are still on my credit report in default status. I was made aware that I can not get a VA Loan unless my loans are out of default. I have paid what I agreed to with Delta Management and am still paying, yet nothing on their end has changed. I feel that I was defrauded by Delta Management and lied to by them just to get my money. I also notice that they have been taking a large amount of each payment as interest and collection agency fees. This amounts to a lot of money as I pay them each week. Is this accurate? Is it legal for Delta Management to not take my loans out of default? I have called repeatedly since XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX and have been told the same thing. I have asked for a supervisor, sent written disputes through their website, sent emails through their website and also the Department of Education with no response from either. although, the website says they will respond within a few days. Also, every time I called the Department of Education Debt Resolution Dept, they told me that I had to talk too Delta Management. Please help me because I have been trying so hard to get this fixed that I am going to call and write my Senator, Governor, Congressman and President of the United States. I ca n't afford for my VA loan to be rejected. I promised my new wife that I would provide a home for us, but I ca n't do it without my Va Loan. This treatment that I received is wrong! I have been deceived! Please help!

83,Communication tactics,"Some months ago ( exact date not recalled ), I allowed my credit card to be used by a man and his wife ( who are long time friends ) for purposes of signing up for aXXXX XXXX account. Apparently they were very unhappy with the service and decided to return to XXXX XXXX with whom they had previously dealt. They contacted XXXX advising them of their desire to cancel service, and returned the equipment in packaging provided by XXXX via the XXXX Post Office, however the gentleman failed to obtain a return receipt for his own records. 
Ultimately XXXX XXXX denied having received the equipment and told the couple they would be charged for it accordingly. A dispute resulted and the couple refused payment or further responsibility, at which point the matter was turned over to some collection agency and from there to this current XXXX who eventually obtained my contact information and began making numerous calls to be, often as many as XXXX to XXXX calls in a single day. 

During my initial efforts to carefully explain and diffuse the situation, I made every possible effort to fully explain the entire matter at great length while remaining very thoughtful, considerate, and non-confrontational at all times with each person who contacted me. This continued for perhaps XXXX to XXXX different calls on various occasions, during which I repeatedly explained matters while also explaining my own extensive health problems and XXXX, but ASSURED that I would assume responsibility for the debt and further assure that it would NOT go unpaid ultimately, while further explaining that I first needed to get extra income available in order to meet existing expenses at moment. 

I was told that they would continue contacting me, and I told them that would be good and well on a reasonable periodic basis, but that the persistent and increasing number of calls on a daily basis was non-productive and could not accomplish anything of meaning either for themselves or my person in getting all of this taken care of. The gentleman at that time assured me that the constant and daily flow of calls would be addressed right away. Regretfully that never happened, and the calls have continued in spite of my efforts to stop them by "" blocking '' and other measures, however I no longer bother to respond because it apparently does n't mean anything. 

In terms of personal health, I have serious heart, respiratory, and central nerve issues all of which are admittedly being aggravated by the stress resulting from what has become a matter of sheer harassment, and while having done my utmost to address these matters in a fully responsible, considerate, and prudent manner it has seemingly been to no avail. I would most deeply appreciate whatever manner of relief might be available at this point, because the added stress is more than a little difficult to deal with at the moment please. 

Originally this dispute revolved around a claim by XXXX XXXX that the equipment returned had not been received, however the claim has since been made that the clamed charges are due to a matter of "" early termination '' leaving me to wonder if they are even clear concerning the stated nature of this entire issue. 

Thank you for your thoughtful attention and consideration in this matter, and I wish you all a wonderful holiday season.

86,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"There were a number of other violations that I could have chosen on the previous question : Communication tactics : Threatened to take legal action, Continued attempts to collect debt I do not owe : Debt is not mine, False statements or representation : Indicated committing crime by not paying debt AND Impersonated attorney, and Improper contact or sharing of information : Talked to a third party about my debt. However, the threat to sue on a debt that is too old to be sued on is the most significant to me, as the alleged debt is outside the statute of limitations and can no longer be collected upon. 

My dad was called by someone who was serving him notice via phone of a "" debt-related civil action pending against [ me ]. '' He was told to take down a phone number and a file number and have me call the company. When I called, I spoke to XXXX XXXX who, after several minutes of prompting, identified company as XXXX XXXX. I was told the company was a law office looking to collect on US Bank credit card account closed in 2008, an account I knew nothing about. I raised concern over the fact that I had never heard of the account or received any type of phone call or literature regarding collection, and over the fact that the debt was disclosed to my father, rather than through direct contact at my number. XXXX first told me they had been calling my number repeatedly and I had been ignoring the calls ( I had never received a call ) and later changed to "" this is the first time we 've sought contact with you. '' I could not get her to tell me the dollar amount of the account more specifically than "" over one thousand dollars. '' I accused the business and account of being illegitimate, and XXXX raised her voice at me and rattled off my full social security number to me twice, despite my protest and pointing out that practice was illegal. She spent the remainder of her time on the phone with me asking why I had n't paid, "" what [ was ] wrong with [ me ], '' and telling me that I needed to pay or they would sue me. I was transferred to transferred to XXXX XXXX. XXXX gave me the total in question ( ~ {$1200.00} ). When I told her the account was not mine, she told me to visit my credit report and mark the account as being the product of identity theft. She told me an investigation into the validity of the account would take approximately 30 days and that she would start the process of having me served with a summons so I could later appear in court with the record of dispute. She asked for my current address to do this ; I gave it to her and got off the phone. 

I checked my credit report where I found no record of the US Bank account. I checked a report generated a year ago and saw the account. The account is not mine ; I have zero recollection of opening or paying on this account. I attempted to open a dispute, and was unable to because the account had come off my report the year prior. I called the company back. I initially spoke to a man who told me that this was obviously my account, accused me of deliberate lying, and demanded I pay the amount today because they planned to garnish my wages or put a lien on my car to satisfy judgment rendered against me. He was speaking to me in a very accusatory and threatening manner, so I demanded that I be able to speak to XXXX again. She told me my only option was to pay or I would be sued. I caved in and I agreed, setting up XXXX payments to begin on the XXXX for an account that is not even mine. I was then transferred to a member of the "" accounting department '' who asked to record me. I allowed him, and he asked that I state my name, address, and telephone number to verify my personal information. 

I later contacted my attorney who informed me I had been victim to illegal practices under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and encouraged me to begin the process of protecting my information.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1787854

I was able to speak with XXXX ( I think was her name ) and the only reason I was able to speak with her is due to my collection agency knowledge, otherwise individuals would have had no idea what was going on or how even to deal with this, so others will be completely unable to help themselves.

109,Disclosure verification of debt,"My wife gave birth to our son in XXXX, 2014, which was a high risk procedure and led to significant expense. We received numerous medical bills and thought we had paid all of them. However, XXXX remained for original creditor, XXXX XXXX, MD, which went to collections in XXXX 2014. The original balance was {$600.00}. My wife was contacted by the debt collection agency, Allied Collection Services, in XXXX, and they advised her that, unless she went into their office within 2 days, they would be forced to take legal action against her. She was understandably upset, so she went into their office, infant in tow, where they convinced her to sign several forms, including setting up a payment plan. She setup the payment auto-debit, according to their terms as they discussed in the office, and they withdrew a couple payments. However, in or around XXXX 2014, Allied filed suit and obtained a judgment against her, claiming she had not honored the terms of the payment arrangement. Upon review of the payment documentation, they required an initial payment of {$50.00} and subsequent payments of {$25.00} per month. My wife was led to believe that she only needed to setup the auto-debit for {$25.00} per month so she "" missed '' the first payment. Upon securing judgment against my wife, Allied Collection Services secured a wage garnishment order against me as well. Upon being advised by my employer of the wage garnishment, my wife contacted Allied Collection Services to attempt to resolve the matter, but they refused to offer any reasonable alternatives ( other than payment in full along with significant additional collection costs ). My wages were garnished until XXXX 2015, at significantly more than {$25.00} a month. At no time did Allied Collection Services ever attempt to contact me prior to, during, or after garnishing my wages, which seemed like a fairly straightforward and simple thing to do. Nevertheless, I did not believe I had any option and allowed the garnishment to proceed. Upon completion, they secured enough money to nearly double the original debt. Further, although Allied had never made any contact with me, or attempted to do so that I am aware, they placed a derogatory tradeline in my credit file, the only such derogatory information in my credit report, and significantly impacting my credit for the next 7 years. I feel it is unconscionable that they were allowed to do as much as they did without first attempting to contact me. It was unconscionable that they created such a false sense of urgency for my wife when they knew full well that they could arrange a payment plan with her over the phone. It was unconscionable that they were so aggressive, so quickly after receiving the collection account, and that they said XXXX thing about the payment plan requirements but embedded different information in the fine print of the documents they pressured my wife to sign. And it is preposterous that I was forced to pay nearly double the original debt, which had not even been with them for 1 month at the time they secured judgment.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1500006

124,Disclosure verification of debt,"It appears that it is AAFES practice to make it difficult for consumers to make payments to their credit card account because it is easy for them to do a Treasury Offset even if the consumer the customer was not properly notified. I say this because my account was placed under AAFES Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program initially in XXXX because AAFES placed my account in collections after they increased my monthly payments without notification then locked me out of accessing my account because I was no longer in the Military. I got out the military in XXXX XXXX and had my account on auto-pay for AAFES to withdraw {$120.00} per month ( my minimum payment each month was about {$80.00} ). I later found out that my account was over 90 days past due because AAFES had increased my payments without notifying me to {$180.00} per month ; so although my direct payments of {$120.00} was received on time every month it was still in default because of a {$60.00} shortage. No notification was received from AAFES to inform me of my new monthly payment amount, nor did AAFES ever send me any notification that my account was past due. I found out of the delinquent account after trying to obtain credit and the creditor informed me that I had a past due account. Once I found out, I attempted to access my AAFES account online and realized that I no longer had access. I called AAFES and was told that since I was no longer in the Military my access was revoked. I explained to the representative that my access was limited after I got out the Military but I was given access to view my statements and pay on my account online. The representative told me that AAFES had revised that policy and so the only way I could access my account was by paper statements. I informed the representative that I had not received any paper statements and she told me that they would send XXXX out. I then asked how could I pay my account and I was told that the only way to correct it is to pay the full balance or settle through the Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program. This program required that I call every month to pay my bills. I complied with the rules of this program every month for the past 3.5 years. When I called to pay my bill in XXXX XXXX, AAFES notified me that they were making it easier for consumers to pay their debt so I could set up auto-pay which would relieve me of calling monthly. I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments thinking that AAFES had finally gotten better. Now I 'm finding out that this was a plight to defraud me and keep me in debt once again. 

I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments where payments of {$180.00} would be debited from my bank account on the XXXX of every month. My XXXX XXXX statement showed that the money was debited as requested on the XXXX XXXX and my next withdrawal was set up for XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX after returning from a 10 day vacation out of State, I received a statement from AAFES which was postmarked XXXX XXXX, XXXX. That statement showed that my account was 30 days past due in the amount of {$180.00} ; a fee of {$25.00} was added for NSF and my XXXX XXXX payment was reversed. I immediately checked my bank statement to see what was going on and verified that there was more than enough money in my account for AAFES to electronically pull the {$180.00} payment which they reported as NSF and charged me a {$25.00} NSF fee. I immediately called AAFES to find out why they charged me a NSF fee and reversed my payment if there was more than enough funds in my account. The representative placed me on hold then came back to ask me what is my bank account number. I verified my account number with her and she told me that they had the wrong account number on file.

Threatening that not settling the debt can result in "" tax consequences '' and threatening to take money they are not entitled to take. Misleading and false representations ; legal documents are sent in plain envelopes or boxes written in sharpie marker.

Also sending collection notices on legal type paper that resembles a legal document. Envelopes also do not indicate the law firm or from a lawyer.

I have recently had to take out a small personal loan to get caught up on the payments, but was unable to even get a loan for more that XXXX dollars because of the negative impact the Citi Student loans had on my credit score. They are unwilling to negotiate a lower payment amount and I ca n't find anyone that would even consider consolidating loans from them. Their associates are much less than pleasant to speak with and leave me feeling like I have no self worth after talking to them.

197,False statements or representation,"I had an agreement to pay on medical bill monthly. After sending in payment for XXXX it was turned over to a collection agency. This however, may not have happened if I had not gone to the billing office to dispute a charge. On several occasions when I pay my co-pay at the doctors office I am later billed for it. I tell them I have my receipt, they tell me its for Lab work, they send it to collection. Collection called to tell me its for Lab work, I go to Billing Office, show my receipt for office visit paid, they tell me its for Lab work, I paid the amount they ask for to get it out of collections. I called Insurance Company, they tell me I do not pay for Lab work if it is done during my visit. The Insurance Company calls the Billing Office, told them I was not responsible for the bill. The Billing Office was to call Insurance Company and Physicians Office to confirm charges, however they did not call the Insurance Office, Physicians Office or me. They will not accept calls from anyone concerning this bill. I do not dispute owing the medical bill, I do dispute the amount because they have accepted XXXX payments since turning it over to collections. I believe that a company should honor their agreement when given. I do not want to lose the physician I have now, but if I have to change I will go back to the old clinic ( never had a problem with billing ). I am not the only one that has had this problem, the ones I have spoken with are afraid of losing their physician. This company is to large to resort to these tactics. I have paid my bill down from around {$3400.00} to XXXX, why send it to collection now? I did not receive a statement this month, but I sent the payment I agreed to pay.

Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,1898441
200,Communication tactics,"Amercican Collections Inc has repeatedly been harassing and intimidating when I have interacted on the phone with them. The manager whom I was transferred to after speaking with XXXX, threatened to call the doctor 's office I owe a debt to and tell the doctor 's office that I am not cooperating with the terms of the payment agreement. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was told as long as I pay the debt prior to the last day of the month, my account will not change. I sent a partial payment using my bill pay in XX/XX/XXXX and was waiting until I saw the payment post to my bank account to pay the difference. On the day the company received the partial payment, on XX/XX/XXXX, they called me and were telling me contradicting information regarding whether or not me giving them money to pay my debt was a problem. I started this payment agreement in XX/XX/XXXX and paid in XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX is not even over and they are threatening that they will have the doctor 's office collect the original amount. When they called on XX/XX/XXXX, I had already been planning on calling them to use my credit card after I saw the check post to my account, as I had done the previous month. Had they called me simply to ask me to pay the difference for XX/XX/XXXX instead of trying to berate me and pressure me, I would have paid right then. Instead they behaved discourteously. They kept using the word, "" generous '' to describe the benevolence of the doctor 's office and I strongly feel the language they were using was meant to belittle me and to intimidate me and to make me feel guilt and shame, despite that I am paying this debt. They are behaving very badly while I am paying this debt. I do not deserve to be harassed and threatened because I am paying a debt. They have lied and misrepresented the information regarding the payment of debts. Also, my husband called ACEI after I called him at work and I was very distressed. When he called ACEI, he spoke with XXXX, who transferred him to the same manager. She disclosed sensitive personal information regarding the debt. She told him who the debt was from, how much it was and all information regarding the debt. To my knowledge, sharing that information is illegal and against confidentiality practices.

Both the agencies removed the debt from my credit report and then a week later it was back under a different name. I disputed it again and then the debt showed back up on the credit report, this time doubled to make it look like XXXX debts ; listed as CACH LLC and CACH , LLC ( with a comma added ). I have been to court twice already and the judge keeps postponing it. I have to go again on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I tried to get the case dismissed because in the affidavits filed by the debtor they said "" Affiant states that the original agreement and document evidencing the creation of this Account is lost or destroyed ... '' The judge would not listen to me and instead postponed the case ( twice ). The attorney handling the account told me she did not have any authority to do anything with the case ( dismissing, make changes, etc. ) because she is just handling the case for an out of state client. The judge told me that he would not do anything with the case ( the last time I went on XXXX XXXX ) unless I bring him a fraud complaint form filled out and the attorney was going to send me XXXX but I have not received it and so far unable to find XXXX. I believe I am being taken advantage of and do not know what to do to fix the situation. Meanwhile, the debtor keeps putting multiple listings on my credit report making it look like I have more bad creditors than there is in reality. The debtor has never made an attempt to collect on this debt until I reported them to the credit reporting agencies. Then they filed a suit in the local court here ( they are from out of state ) while still not attempting to collect on this debt. Their own sworn affidavit to the court ( notarized and delivered by the Sheriff 's department to my door ) states they have no proof of the creation of the account ( see above ). Also, the debtor, after I disputed the account on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, placed the account opened status as XXXX XXXX, but on the official court documents and affidavit ( filed on XXXX XXXX one month after I disputed the account ) the debtor can not state when the account was created.

209,False statements or representation,"This complaint is against CACH , LLC, dba XXXX & XXXX. Funds were levied from an account to which I have no financial interest & which contained the direct deposit proceeds of my mother 's social security benefit payments. The funds taken exceeded the maximum as stated. Funds were not posted or forwarded as I was told had been done and were held for a period of two years after seizure. Both organizations failed to respond in a timely manners with accurate information to my requests or to the requests made to each other resulting in an erroneous accrual of interest and continued damage to my credit rating. As a result of errors a second account was erroneously levied and an additional amount seized from a savings account which contained the proceeds of my husband 's Veteran 's Administration XXXX Benefits. To this date I have received false information and have yet to get resolution to this matter. I am seeking your assistance. The particulars follow. 
Due to an unexpected job loss and {$80000.00} per annum in income coupled with a sudden increase in expenses my husband and I found ourselves in a difficult and very emotionally painful situation of having to renegotiate our credit card debt. We were unable to come to a resolution with XXXX and the balance continued to rise exponentially even though we were making payments. In lieu of this we decided to focus our efforts elsewhere and unfortunately the account went into default. The account was purchased by CACH/XXXX. A judgment was ordered by XXXX XXXX XXXX Court and a default judgment entered on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I did not fight the judgment because I did in fact owe the money. I did not agree with the amount but felt that there was little I could do. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX just before the XXXX Holiday when banks and businesses are closed, a levy was sent to XXXX in XXXX, AZ and funds in the amount of {$4800.00} were withdrawn. No notice was given and it was only discovered when my mother went to access her account. This account was my Mother 's Social Security direct deposit account. I was listed, along with my sister, as joint in the event that my mother needed emergency funds and was unable to access them for any reason. After multiple phone calls back and forth between myself, XXXX XXXX, and CACH/XXXX as I attempted to have the illegally seized funds returned to my mother without success I made an agreement with my mother to pay her back. At this point I considered the matter closed and made restitution to my mother. Over one year later, in XXXX I received a notice from CACH/XXXX stating that the amount was still outstanding. I immediately called them and after being transferred around several times talked with XXXX XXXX who assured me that the matter would be resolved and that the funds were with the XXXX County Sheriff 's Office. She would not give me a phone number or contact that I could follow up with stating that the matter was between them and the Sheriff 's Office. In XXXX, XXXX I received a letter from CACH/XXXX stating that they were willing to renegotiate the amount owed and wipe out up to 70 % of the debt. As the XXXX season was approaching and I was dealing with a multitude of family issues I decided to contact them after the holiday the following week. Imagine my surprise when I went to access our savings account at XXXX only to discover that no funds were available because a lien had been served by CACH/XXXX and {$5100.00} had been seized. This now brings the total taken from accounts to {$10000.00} which is {$4500.00} more than the original amount ordered. As of this date I have received a check for {$4400.00} from XXXX XXXX returning some of the funds taken in error.

225,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"I ca n't believe the horrible service I am receiving with USAA. I got an auto loan XX/XX/XXXX and it was paid off XX/XX/XXXX ( to make room on our debt ratio for a new home ). Up until that point, the loan was reported as paid as agreed with no lates. 

Suddenly when I paid off the loan, the loan was reported as having a 30 day late payment. To me, it is suspicious as to why that payment was never reported late before, but when I decide to pay off the loan, now it 's late? So I investigate further. After investigation, there was a payment in XXXX that was made to them, but never applied to the loan. The bank says they never received the payment. So, I find out that XXXX XXXX issued a cashier 's check to them on XX/XX/XXXX, but the check was never cashed. After further investigation, I find out that the check was delivered to them on XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX and delivered to the front desk. Their response, they never recieved the payment, so it is not a bank error - and they left the 30 day late payment on my credit report. This XXXX late payment caused my credit scores to drop XXXX points on XXXX bureau - XXXX points on another and I 'm still waiting on the last bureau to get this negative information. 

On my credit report, I have no late payments and my other loans with USAA are always made on time. This XXXX missing payment is truly an anomoly. Instead of fixing their mistake, they continue to give me the run around. They tell me that they are researching it, but most likely it is n't a banking error. They tell me that even though they signed for it, it still is not their mistake. When I asked why, when I called to inquire about the late notices I was getting, they kept telling me that there was a small balance left over from the previous month, even though payment was made for more than the payment due amount. I was told to disregard the notices. 

My question is if I have proof a payment was mailed to them, and signed/delivered to them by XXXX, how is this anything but a banking error?",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,1698012

Bottom line : Before filing this complaint with CFPB, I have attempted to have this debt expunged from my record by explaining to both XXXX and Ally Financial that this is debt is the result of an accounting error made eight years after the vehicle was leased ( paid in full ). Both parties refuse to help me, they both continue to advise me that I must speak to the other to get this resolved, and neither of their management representatives has offered any clarity on this matter. 

I have read other consumer complaints regarding Ally Financial and XXXX XXXX. It seems as though I am not alone in my experience of the unethical business practices these XXXX companies engage in to make a buck. My credit worthiness has suffered tremendously as a result of this Charge Off that was reported to the credit bureaus. I did not accrue this debt. If I am unable to resolve this issue with the help of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am prepared to pursue this matter with an attorney because of personal integrity as well as holding these XXXX companies to decent ethical standards. 

Note : As I mentioned, I gave Ally Financial quite a bit of information when I opened a complaint with them regarding this account. I suspect they will try to pawn this issue off to XXXX XXXX, but prior to opening the complaint, Ally Financial had no information regarding the debt when I gave them my Social Security Number and full name.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2051353

255,Disclosure verification of debt,"Upon application for mortgage, XXXX XXXX informed me of a bad debt on my credit report from Bank Of America ( BoA ). I have no accounts with BoA. I called BoA who stated I had a past due balance of {$360.00} on a credit card account. I told BoA I did not have a credit card with them and asked for more details. The BoA customer service rep stated that my current statement showed a past due balance of {$360.00}. I reiterated that I do not have a credit card with BoA. I then asked when the account was opened, when the charges were made, and by whom. The rep stated that he did not have access to that information and transferred me to another department, at which time I was disconnected from the system. I called back. Different rep. Went through the whole story again. Rep tried to transfer me to a different department. I declined and requested documentation/verification of the debt be sent to me in writing. I provided my current address. Rep said would send verification and I should receive it in 7-10 days. Never received it. Called back a few weeks later, same drill, same promise to send documentation through the mail. I still have not received it. Called again yesterday. Yesterday the rep "" XXXX '' informed me that he had to transfer me to the Fraud division because the name on the account in question does not match my social security number. Transferred to me to "" XXXX '' in the Fraud division. "" XXXX '' asked me many demographic questions to verify my identity then told me privacy rules prohibited her from giving me information about the account since it was not in my name. I then asked XXXX to remove the information from all XXXX credit bureaus until BoA sorted out their issues. XXXX denied my request as she claimed not to have the authority to update the credit bureaus. She stated the fraud investigation would take approx 30 days. I told her this was unacceptable as I was in the mortgage underwriting process and BoA needed to take care of the situation. I again requested verification/documentation of the debt on my credit report as I had nothing in writing from BoA as of this date. Citing privacy concerns again, "" XXXX '' transferred me to another department, where I was promptly disconnected. Called back. Got "" XXXX ''. Explained the situation to XXXX. XXXX unable to help. Transferred me to "" XXXX ''. Explained the situation to XXXX. XXXX explained she was unable to help. Requested XXXX send me documentation of the account, the charges, and status of account. XXXX only had access to XXXX and XXXX statements and agreed to send them to me even though they did not contain data about when acct was opened, what the charges were, or when the charges were incurred. I asked her to transfer me to someone who could provide that information. XXXX transferred me to another dept where I was promptly disconnected ( again ). 

I have made numerous attempts to obtain verification of this debt with BoA and they simply can not /will not comply. I can not file disputes with the credit bureaus at this juncture because I can not close my mortgage loan with open disputes on my credit report. I 've been getting the runaround since XXXX and I 'm hoping you can encourage BoA to provide the debt verification/documentation to which I am legally entitled.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1336334

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I began receiving several alerts at the same time, from my credit monitoring service related to various companies who claim that I owe them a debt. The majority of what I could glean from the credit alert was that the alleged debts were related to medical collections although a few of the alerts did not state any circumstances regarding the debts. In the case of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, they appear to be the same company using the tactic of reporting the same collection to various credit reporting agencies but using different names in an attempt to damage my credit and coerce me to pay for a debt that I do not owe. I have never received bills from the said companies and I have no idea what the nature of the collection may be. 
In the case of ATG CREDIT LLC, the amounts owed are different than proposed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX but I am concerned that this company is somehow related to or acting on behalf of XXXX and XXXX since their collection attempt is also related to alleged "" medical '' debts and it was reported to the credit unions on the same day that XXXX and XXXX placed the negative charge against my credit. In addition, if they are related companies coercing me to pay a debt not owed while holding my credit worthiness status hostage, the act of reporting the same debt to different agencies, changing account numbers, changing their corporation names and addresses is manipulative and is an exaggeration to deliberately coerce me to send money for a debt not owed. 
Please advise me whether or not this practice is illegal in the State of Florida or under Federal Law.

I have worked some temp jobs that barely pay any bills and presently I am caring for XXXX of my grandchildren and on assistance to help meet their needs. I can not get an official transcript as well, therefore certain job opportunities that I have had I was not able to get the job offer. I have kept in contact with Mohela at every step to ensure I am communicating this issue with them and asking for the proper paperwork so that I will not go into default or something would be reported on my credit falsely. I filled out the paperwork ( financial statement ) saying at this time I could not repay twice. I have communicated this information to them on several occasions via the phone and via the Internet. I have no outstanding late fees due, yet Mohela has reported derogatory reports to the credit bureaus ( all XXXX ) and has cause a decrease in my credit score - XXXX points whereby the loans are showing not paid on time and derogatory.

( CA herein ). First major delinquency was XX/XX/XXXX due to loss of employment & the balance due according to XXXX credit bureaus is {$3600.00}, but balance due as reported by CA {$3500.00}. The XXXX value of the repo 'd SUV for dealer trade in TODAY is {$1200.00} & SUV was repo 'd in XX/XX/XXXX. I did n't receive notice of the sale of the vehicle, but was furnished a copy of what CA claimed to have sent me regarding resale. No deficiency balance ever noted!!! A couple years went by with no correspondence from CA until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when the sheriff delivered me a final judgment, entered by default as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Upon receiving this, I called XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX herein ) who identified themselves as debt collectors for CA saying the balance due as of judgment is now {$6900.00} & to call for payment arrangements. I was confused and skeptical, as I had already paid roughly {$20000.00} on the contract & there was no record of a deficiency balance applied. 
After researching more on my own, as circumstantially I could not afford legal advisory, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I sent a request via certified mail usps to XXXX for a complete debt validation to include all info in my file, the original contract & a full accounting of all transactions. In response to my request on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I only received a general response & a copy of the final judgment, no debt validation & no account of the proceeds, deficiency balance or how the sale was processed & there are NO DOCUMENTED PROCEEDS from the deficiency balance towards what is owed, EVER. I was hesitant to make pymnt arrangements in fear of validating the debt, but when I called the courthouse to verify the judgment, it was on file as a legally binding document. As of XX/XX/XXXX, CA has reported the account status with all XXXX credit bureaus with the delinquencies and repossession noted, but never once was a judgment or public notice recorded & said account has been closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, to be scheduled for removal by XX/XX/XXXX. All XXXX credit bureaus reported the same data. Something was n't right & I had read hundreds of complaints via internet regarding unfair & illegal practices by CA. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I hesitantly made the first payment of 9 for the {$75.00} arrangement agreement to XXXX from my XXXX checking and have the records. The most recent payment cleared XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Within that time period, I 've only received XXXX notices from XXXX, the most recent dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, stating the amount due was {$7400.00} & that their "" client has informed them of a special opportunity to fully satisfy this debt by payment of a significantly reduced amount ''. No other forms of correspondence attempted. Last Thursday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to use my debit card and it was declined even though I had over {$1700.00} in my account & had just deposited my payroll. XXXX bank informed me that my account was levied by CA & without any prior notice from my bank or CA. The telephone # I was given sends me to a TN county clerk & that is all the contact info provided. I still have yet to receive any notice from my bank or XXXX or CA regarding the levy & questioning if all this is legal practice. I 've heard of CA judgments being vacated after entered due to CA filing fraudulent affidavits with the courts. When I calculate the amount due under the terms by CA in the judgment, I get completely different amounts and I think they are suing for interest on attorney fees, other interest charges and there are credits of {$0.00} for deficiency and resale of SUV? I definitely can not afford a lawyer now & thinking this is a fraudulent attempt to collect before the SOL is up because the judgment is fraud.

Funds were levied from an account to which I have no financial interest & which contained the direct deposit proceeds of my mother 's social security benefit payments. The funds taken exceeded the maximum as stated. Funds were not posted or forwarded as I was told had been done and were held for a period of two years after seizure. Both organizations failed to respond in a timely manners with accurate information to my requests or to the requests made to each other resulting in an erroneous accrual of interest and continued damage to my credit rating. As a result of errors a second account was erroneously levied and an additional amount seized from a savings account which contained the proceeds of my husband 's Veteran 's Administration XXXX Benefits. To this date I have received false information and have yet to get resolution to this matter. I am seeking your assistance. The particulars follow. 
Due to an unexpected job loss and {$80000.00} per annum in income coupled with a sudden increase in expenses my husband and I found ourselves in a difficult and very emotionally painful situation of having to renegotiate our credit card debt. We were unable to come to a resolution with XXXX and the balance continued to rise exponentially even though we were making payments. In lieu of this we decided to focus our efforts elsewhere and unfortunately the account went into default. The account was purchased by XXXX XXXX. A judgment was ordered by XXXX XXXX Superior Court and a default judgment entered on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not fight the judgment because I did in fact owe the money. I did not agree with the amount but felt that there was little I could do. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX just before the XXXX XXXX when banks and businesses are closed, a levy was sent to Wells Fargo Bank in XXXX, AZ and funds in the amount of {$4800.00} were withdrawn. No notice was given and it was only discovered when my mother went to access her account. This account was my Mother 's Social Security direct deposit account. I was listed, along with my sister, as joint in the event that my mother needed emergency funds and was unable to access them for any reason. After multiple phone calls back and forth between myself, Wells Fargo, and XXXX as I attempted to have the illegally seized funds returned to my mother without success I made an agreement with my mother to pay her back.

406,Can't repay my loan,"Perhaps this is a common problem. I have had private law school loans since 1998. These loans are currently split between XXXX service providers - XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) and Access Group ( ACS ). Since my loans went into repayment, I never missed a payment, and paid my full amount owed every month. However, in the last couple of years, I 've had some challenges. I had to take time off from full-time employment due to some health issues, and we needed to relocate for my husband 's job across the country. I had a baby. I needed to stay home for a while. With both loan providers, I was able to suspend the federal loans, but the private ones have been more problematic. I am told I have no other options with those at this point. The monthly for ACS is {$270.00} and the monthly for XXXX is {$230.00}. The financial stress on our family is significant because of this, as I am not bringing in an income and not receiving any type of unemployment assistance. The lenders claim I have no options. I asked if it might be possible for me to pay a lower amount each month until I obtain employment. The answer was no, that this would still be considered default, even if I paid XXXX-XXXX percent of the amount owed each month. Essentially paying a substantial portion counts for nothing. I feel that this makes no sense and is borderline predatory. It seems as if trying to work out an arrangement with them is impossible. I understand why people give up and do n't pay at all. However, I have excellent credit and it 's important to me to retain this. It 's going to wipe out our savings over the next few months. I think the unwillingness to work with clients during financial difficulties is a real problem. This is not credit card debt. Most of us with these loans are responsible consumers. The failure to work with an individual who is willing to pay the maximum possible in his/her current financial situation, is something that I felt was worth documenting.

XX/XX/XXXX I found out they had garnished my pay check at XXXX but also my Utah state tax return was taken.

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down and investigated by Fed 's for taking to much in fees up front and additional fees throughout each settlement process.

They have been unable to send me any bill from the institution that they say they represent. I have always maintained medical insurance. My insurance has always paid over the amount that the service was worth. If these charges are for medical services, they are 1. Fraudulent, 2. For services I did not receive, 3. Services that I did not agree to or want but I was charged anyway. There is so much fraud in the Insurance /Medical/Collection agency field ... It does so much damage to people, and their credit. 
The fraudulent billing practices of the medical institutions, and the people who work at these institutions along with the collection agencies they hire, give them the ability to extort money from the public by having all your private information which facilitates the creation of bills that go to their collection agencies like CMRE which then ruin your credit. The fraudulent actions of CMRE, are keeping me and a lot of other people from refinancing. 
See Exhibit B, Mortgage Company wants to pay CMRE, before I can refinance to a lower rate. The Mortgage Company explains it by repeating ; 'it 's the XXXX Selling guide '' that is to blame and they have to follow those guidelines. They are insisting that these accounts be paid. This demand is based on hearsay information for charges that CMRE put on my credit report.

I spoke with the lawyer listed on the debit, and he worked with the Wells Fargo lawyer to return my money. 
While I am glad to have my money back I am still troubled by the gross negligence displayed by the bank in taking the money out of my account without verifying any personal information beyond my name ( no SSN, no DoB, etc ). When I asked the bank for an explanation they offered none, then after originally agreeing to escalate the issue to their executive office they began an endless loop of transferring my call to other office that could not help. 
I was lucky to catch this transgression when I did, and even luckier that I was able to live for a short time without the funds they took, but that does not excuse the reckless behavior of Wells Fargo. I hereby ask the CFPB to investigate Wells Fargo in their lack of due diligence when paying debt collectors and prosecute the bank for any illegal activities that the Bureau uncovers.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1792064

After paying the balance in full in XXXX, I closed the account and made no additional purchases. I eventually left the XXXX in XXXX and subsequently took up residences in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and now XXXX. 

I bought my current home in XXXX. When applying for this mortgage, my credit report had a clear record, without any delinquencies. 

On XXXX XXXX of this year, I received a certified letter from AAFES 's collection agency XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) that provided notice of a wage garnishment to be applied due to outstanding debt to the federal government of more than {$2000.00}. I had no previous knowledge of these charges and began to investigate.

The following timeline and facts apply : On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received a certified letter from AAFES/XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), that advised me of a Notice of Intent to initiate administrative wage garnishment proceedings. The action stemmed from an apparent AAFES debt. ( ATTACHED ) On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I called AAFES and collected as much information as they would tell me.

The original certified letter received from AAFES/XXXX made no mention of this and only addressed wage garnishment. Federal law under the Treasury Offset Program includes a Due Process prerequisite that requires a 60-day notice is provided to the debtor of the intent to offset as well as the opportunity to dispute the debt.

I was asked to co-sign the student loans which I did. The loans varied in amounts - usually around {$10000.00} - and the interest rates also varied but averaged about 8 %. 

In about 2013 or so, there was public outrage over the high interest rates that college students were being charged, and so Wells Fargo contacted ME to see if I would be interested in consolidating my son 's student loans with a much lower interest rate. I said of course I would. So with the understanding that everything besides the interest rate would basically be the same - the outstanding amount, the term, and the fact that I would still be a co-signer guaranteeing the loan - I signed and returned the documents that were sent to me. 

During the early years of the loan, my son was still a student and had no source of income. So I paid the entire monthly balance myself. For about two years after he left college I continued to make the entire payments since I was the co-signer. Because I was not the student, however, I was not entitled to any income tax deduction for the amounts that I was paying. 

In the last year, my son has become employed and is now capable of making the student loan payment payments himself and receiving the income tax deductions. So I contacted Wells Fargo and asked that the request for the monthly loan payment be sent to him instead of me. I knew I would continue to the be the co-signer and guarantee the loan, but he now needed the income tax deduction for the payments he would be making. Wells Fargo responded back to me saying that when the student loan was consolidated, I agreed to be entirely responsible for the loan and that my son was no longer responsible for payment. 
I told them that I NEVER agree to be totally responsible, especially for a student loan where I was not the beneficiary ( the student ) and for which I received no income tax deduction for my payments. After discussing this with the Wells Fargo Student Loan people for several weeks, they would not budge and will not recognize my son as the legitament holder and beneficiary of the loan.

596,Can't repay my loan,"With the downturn in the economy, I was faced with some tough decisions ; to plod along and hope things got better or to go to school in pursuit of a degree. I chose the later but with that decision came the need to access student loans, which have only increased personal stress because I 've reached a juncture of needing to finish with an XXXX Degree and then go onto to acquiring a XXXX Degree. I can not even afford to finish with the credits needed for the XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced to make another difficult decision and I filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy. Now, I know that Congress repealed discharging of XXXX, but, it is wrong that this government is making huge profits in high-interest loans from students who simply wish to better their station in life. We are taxpayers and in essence, make it possible for the government to loan us money we 've paid into the system in the first place. This government spends trillions in support of other countries and many of those countries ( like XXXX ) provide free tuition for those who wish to continue their education after high school. It is morally wrong for a country that spends XXXX dollars in funding the XXXX Military XXXX, taxpayer subsidies to corporations who outsource American jobs, the bail-out of XXXX XXXX at the tune of XXXX dollars, which to date amounts to close to XXXX dollars ... .all, again, at the American taxpayers expense.This government 's solution for assisting student 's with their debt? Determining their yearly income ( mine before taxes was around XXXX ) and basing a pay-back plan on that income. The amount I was told I would need to pay was XXXX per month. That would relegate me to XXXX per year in payments on XXXX, alone. My rent debt amounts to approximately XXXX per year. So ... .you can see that right now, before taxes, that would bring the total for just these XXXX debts to XXXX over a years time. I have to ask if our government has simply lost all sense of reality ( it certainly appears to be the case ), in which case you should get out of your taxpayer paid salaried political seats and join the real world. I am thoroughly disgusted in this government that I 've always defended. No longer can I defend a government that appears to be about serving party interests and pandering to XXXX XXXX rather than serving the people ... .you know ... .the XXXX %! Now, considering the total of just those XXXX debts ... .and take those amounts out of pre-taxed income, not considering any other living expenses ; do you not consider your objectives absurd. If not, you should, because you will be judged on you have grossly betrayed the American people in lieu of serving the dictates of your corporate master ; XXXX XXXX. I am sure my post will not be considered cow-towing ... which I am pretty sure is expected. But as elected leaders, and all tens of thousands of bureaucracies taxpayers make possible, is n't the term 'serving the people ' a fallacy? Should n't the term be ; 'taxpayers serving their government ' a far more appropriate term? Repaying this debt is going to be a major hardship. I am no longer a spring chicken ( sorry for the cliche ) but I continue to work hard. It grieves me to think that we come into this world with a relative few years to adulthood and then the remainder is serving our government without any of the perks we taxpayers have earned. Our government is rewarded for doing what, exactly? Yes, I am angry. I 've tried the positive energy route, to no avail. Stop punishing students and start rewarding those who excel in college with high GPA 's. My own GPA started out at XXXX and I ended with a XXXX. We students who are mired in debt need realistic solutions instead of the same old, very predictable responses from our elected 'leaders '!

It was in my husband name, he died XX/XX/XXXX, but we filed joint taxes and the IRS wanted the money from me. We had never received a XXXX from B of A. 
I did our finances for the 20 years we were married. I had had a B of A credit card years ago, but he never had anything B of A. The IRS said I have to clear it up with B of A. 
My 1st call was with a rep that was no help what so ever. On my next call I got a very nice young man that scoured all B of A computer systems with my husbands social security number and could not find him anywhere. They did find that old credit card of mine. He gave me the XXXX Research and Dispute Dept. 's fax number and had me send the IRS letter and request a copy of the XXXX we had never received. I waited about 5 days to make sure the fax had been distributed to someone and was n't just sitting in a basket somewhere and followed the fax with a call to that Dept. They also could find no record of any trace of my husband let alone the XXXX sent to the IRS and not us. A very nice Manager there took over and called a couple of times to say no luck. Finally I received a copy of the XXXX in the mail. It has the Debt description as "" Direct Auto ''. The address for my husband is over 20 years old. We were married 20 years and he had left that city probably 3 years before that. And he had a car financed by a private party nearly paid off when I met him. It was not Direct Auto. He had bad credit when I met him and I believe there was a bankruptcy, but from XX/XX/XXXX I can swear he never had an auto or any kind of loan with Direct Auto or Bank of America.

663,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I would like to report a case of student loan fraud by Wells Fargo Student Services. I recently graduated from XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I took out a loan with Wells Fargo in XXXX 2014 and contacted representatives with questions several times during my loan process. I was informed on several occasions that my loan would not accrue interests and that I was not permitted to make any payment on my loan amount until my 6 month deferment period was over. Specifically, I contacted Wells Fargo representatives twice and was explicitly informed that I was "" not permitted '' to make any payments on my student loan while I was still enrolled in school. 

I called on XXXX separate occasions to verify this statement and this claim was never contradicted. I also asked to receive a copy of my promissory agreement to verify this claim and never received one. 

I finally reached a representative last week who informed me that not only had my loan been accruing interest, but that I was able to submit payments on my loan the entire time. 

Since then, I have contacted Wells Fargo several times, and none of my requests have been met. I am yet to receive a copy of my promissory agreement. I was informed that Wells Fargo management can not accept responsibility for their employees poor information and I was told that I most likely misunderstood the difference between the phrases "" do not have to make payments '' and "" can not make payments ''. However, on XXXX separate occasions I was specifically told I was "" not permitted '' to make a payment, suggesting that it was their representatives who may have been confused about the meaning of the standard Wells Fargo verbiage. 

During several conversations with Wells Fargo management, they emphasized that their loan specialists most likely informed me that I was not "" obligated '' to pay back a loan but could do so at any time. This was not the case, although the phrase "" do n't have to pay off the loan while you are enrolled in school '' frequently came up. Although I explicitly asked about concurrently paying off my loan, this frequently repeated expression is potentially -- and likely intentionally -- misleading. The manager I spoke with informed me that an internal complaint is the "" best they could do '' for my situation ; in the meantime, their confusion has cost me approximately {$1500.00} in interest-related fees on my loan. 

Furthermore, I am still unable to access my online account despite multiple calls to Wells Fargo technical support. I conduct online banking for all my other accounts, and do not have an issue accessing my Wells Fargo Mortgage online account. Essentially, this is not user error- I am specifically unable to access my student loan portal and have not received any support from Wells Fargo in this regard. 

My husband and I are both XXXX ; I recently transferred over tot he XXXX XXXX. While we understand consumer responsibility, we sought clarification on written documents throughout the process and received none. Additionally, we explicitly asked for additional information that we never received. My attempts at contacting management were infructuous at best ; I am still waiting on an email containing our promissory agreement as an attachment or a way to defray our interest by transmitting my husband 's military orders. 

I believe that Wells Fargo 's loan department is intentionally misleading potential customers and withholding information about the terms of their loans and hope this report can coerce Wells Fargo to clarify their lending practices and information dissemination.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1379500

688,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"Initially, I received a call from Receivables Performance Management. They only stated their name and asked for me to verify my identity. Unsure of the nature of their business, I asked what kind of business they conduct and told them I did n't feel comfortable disclosing my identity through sensitive information without knowing who they are as a company. They refused and said they could n't legally disclose that due to privacy issues. This seemed suspect to me so I refused and hung up. 

I called XXXX XXXX because I had just closed an account with them to see if there was any connection.

Please be advised that it will take within thirty days to update. '' On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I was notified by XXXX that a new collection had been added to my XXXX credit report in the amount of {$49.00} from Receivables Performance Management. 

I attempted to call Receivables Performance Management, but there was no answer after numerous rings ... not even a selection menu. No answer at all.

I explained my situation and asked them to rectify things with the collection agency with whom they have chosen to align ... communicating my frustration with how this collection agency either broke the law, or was operating on the fringes of the law. 

XXXX XXXX effectively stated that they could do nothing to remove the inaccurate credit report addition but resend the same information that they had sent in XXXX. Receivables Performance Management does n't answer their phone. This is the reason for my complaint with the CFPB.

726,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"Request for Credit Reversal and DisputeMy name is__ and I am a United States XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran who is appalled at the treatment that I have been receiving from Sallie Mae , Inc . I 've served my country honorably as an officer for 21 years and never thought that my financial future would be scarred by a student loan company. My XXXX credit has been damaged due to errors and misinformation given by Sallie Mae loan representatives. As the cosigner on my niece 's student loans, I am requesting a credit reversal of the derogatory information that have stained my credit reports. I 've also discovered that there are thousands of online customer complaints documenting the same errors, inefficiencies and misinformation made by Sallie Mae employees. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I spoke to XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) regarding loan __. I told him that my niece and her family were undergoing economic hardship and that my retired status, along with the care of my Mom placed me in a difficult position in terms of repayment of the loans. XXXX mentioned a forbearance option. I stated to him that my niece and her father had been granted the maximum in forbearances stated by Sallie Mae. He then stated that since the family was still undergoing economic hardship that he would appeal to management for another forbearance, provided that I would pay a {$50.00} fee and give him a financial statement over the phone. I asked if deferment was an option, and he said no because my niece was not in school. I gave him the information, paid the {$50.00} fee, XXXX assured me again that he would do everything he could to get a favorable answer from management regarding the forbearance request and to keep my credit from being negatively affected at XXXX. He said if he was n't able to do it, I would receive a call. I never received any follow up calls stating that the forbearance was not approved. 
On the XXXX of XXXX, I called Sallie Mae 's military division to inquire about additional programs for veterans and it was there that I was told that the forbearance that XXXX had processed was denied and the derogatory information was reported to the credit bureaus. The representative said that XXXX should have told me that it was not likely that another forbearance would be granted because of the XXXX opportunities had been exhausted. I also discovered that with the approved forbearance in the past, that Sallie Mae never went back to re-adjust the days past due and those were also on my credit reports. I paid the {$50.00} in good faith and was misinformed and disregarded. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, my niece and her father called and spoke with XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) to request a forbearance for loan__. XXXX took their financial information and said that he would push for a 60-day forbearance, however he could n't guarantee it but would work hard to get it approved. They called back after not hearing from Sallie Mae on that day and was told by a Sallie Mae assistant that nothing was done yet. They were then transferred back to the forbearance department and XXXX took the call and said that everything had been take care of and that someone would call. When the payments were late, I received numerous calls throughout the day. Each time I called Sallie Mae and was told that a follow up call would be made, no one called me, regarding a status update. 
During the early part of XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) and was given information that was reported after the previous forbearance had been approved. My niece and father were told by XXXX that with each and every forbearance, that it should have been only XXXX 30-day late reported.

727,Can't repay my loan,"Please read the following response that I sent you in response to your initial email & then explain to me how you expect me to pay back the loan??? 
"" Dear Government : Thank you for your kind email. 
I would have gladly paid back this loan earlier was it not for the following facts : 1 ) : The course taught or was supposed to teach me XXXX. When I completed the course a year later XXXX was being taught & being used which meant that my studies in XXXX was a waste of time, money & effort. Furthermore it meant that I would have to spend yet another year learning XXXX, & who is going to pay for that??? 
2 ) : When I graduated from university in XXXX I learned very quickly that it mattered not so much what I studied but where I studied it. I live near XXXX ( XXXX ) major hospitals : 1 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital ; 2 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital XXXX XXXX ; 3 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital ; 4 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital ; 5 ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital. Not one of the aforementioned hospitals have ever heard of the XXXX XXXX, the institution that talked me into taking the course!!! 
3 ) : Since I am currently XXXX with XXXX XXXX I have to see an endless stream of doctors. As a matter of fact they are about the ONLY people I see these days!!! I have noticed that when they draft a script or notes, the computer automatically assigns XXXX & XXXX codes which means that someone is n't sitting in the backroom assigning codes from reference books. 
4 ) : I always thought that a placement service served to place their candidates in jobs. I discovered that The XXXX XXXX did not & does not provide such a service. Their idea of such a service was to simply list them as a reference. 
5 ) : Upon graduation I learned that voice recognition was being used in coding meaning that the system would assign codes in accordance with vocal statements of diagnoses. 
6 ) : I registered for the course in the expectation of finding suitable employment upon course completion. The XXXX XXXX told me that there was a great demand for coders & that finding suitable employment would not be a problem for me. I later discovered that every job listing answered REQUIRED a 2-3 experience. How am I going to get the experience when no one is going to hire me because I do not have the required experience??? 
7 ) : I completed the course in XXXX. It is now XXXX. Five years later! I have not profited in any manner whatsoever from my studies nor do I expect to as I have forgotten everything that I studied given the passage of time. 
I wrote to the U S Justice Department about this matter as I strongly feel that I was sold a bad bill of goods meaning fraud which, unless I am mistaken, is a felony, but they could not be bothered. Instead they sent me information on where to find a place to live, information that in no way whatsoever addressed my problem. Currently I am living on XXXX & XXXX. 
You would be correct in assuming that I have a chip on my shoulder, but who would n't given what I have described above? Having had to declare Chapter XXXX bankruptcy last XXXX that was partially fueled by not finding a job in XXXX XXXX & XXXX my credit is already destroyed. I dont think that you can destroy my credit more than it has already been. 
The other part of the Chapter XXXX was caused by debts incurred from XXXX XXXX when my late wife was diagnosed & operated for what later became on Friday, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX hours XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was unable to work during that time as I did what I thought every husband was supposed to do by remaining home to care for her given that she required XXXX three weeks of every month. A death certificate will be submitted upon request as proof.

796,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I 'm not satisfied with Well Fargo 's response concerning this student loan. This loan was opened by my dad several years ago without my knowledge. I discovered the loan was opened in my name 3 years later when applying for a car loan. My dad advised that he would continue to pay on the loan, and not to worry. Never mind the fact that I never received a notice or statement from Wells Fargo concerning this loan prior to me reviewing my credit file. My dad is now retired and due to XXXX is unable to maintain the monthly bill for this loan. 

Although I never agreed to this loan, I do not want to pursue criminal charges against my dad, BUT I do not agree with Wells ' Fargo business practices concerning my dispute about this loan. This loan has gone into default twice and has been reported as 30 days late to my credit bureau. I 've told my dad countless times that if he thinks he is not going to be able to make the payment to contact me before it becomes late so that I can try to cover the payment. However, that has not happened. My mom did let me know that due to my dad being out of work and without a car due to a car accident, that he will not be able to make a payment on time. 

I contacted Wells Fargo today, because I feel that I 'm left out of the loop in terms of when a payment is due, if it 's behind, etc. The only time I 'm made aware that a payment is due, is when it 's already BEHIND!!! How is that fair for a consumer who is only trying to do the right thing by repaying a loan that was never requested by her? Additionally, my request to Wells Fargo was to grant me access to view this account online, so that I do not find myself in the same predicament and wind up with another 30 day late reporting on my credit file. The representative, although pleasant, did not have any options to assist me. She advised me as a co-signer that I do not have access to view the loan online, only the borrower can, and also advised to get a monthly statement, I would have to call in and request it!!! Again how is this fair??? 

I 've come to terms that Wells Fargo is not going to do the right thing and remove my name from this loan, but to not give me all the tools to manage the loan, by granting me online access, which is how I maintain all my other bills, which are paid on time, might I add!!! Then to state I have to call in to request a statement each month is mind-boggling, BUT if a payment is behind, there is no hesitation in reporting this on MY credit file. I feel that this is not only unfair, by unlawful, and it feels they are putting me in a position where I always have to worry about whether this bill is going to be paid on time. It has caused me great stress, and has prevented me from being able to obtain a competitive home loan. With this recent 30 day late on my credit file, my score dropped XXXX pts.!!! 

My request from Wells Fargo at this time is to do the right thing, which would be to remove these 30 day lates from my credit file, since they do not give me the proper tools to manage this loan. I also request that if they are not going to remove my name from this loan that they also grant me access to view and make payments online, and mail monthly statements without me having to request them each month.

I borrowed {$30000.00}, paid back the expected total amount of the loan, but not on the originally anticipated schedule.

917,False statements or representation,"Back in XXXX I communicated with a collection agency named Continental Central Credit. I spoke to them because they had a collection account in their office which they were reporting on my credit report. When I spoke with this collection agency, I spoke with an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX was the collector who was in charge of this particular account. When I spoke with him, I explained my situation to him and we had agreed upon me paying an amount of {$700.00} as well as having the account removed from my credit report due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the nature of the debt. We agreed that I would post date a payment on the XXXX of XXXX because that is when I got paid for the month. I only get paid once a month. 

I thought the situation was taken care of until I received another notice saying that they will sue me if I do n't pay the amount of the post dated payment as well as a {$25.00} Non sufficient fund fee. At this point I had my representative step in and try to figure out what was going on because I know I had funds in my bank account. In fact, because of this entire ordeal, I was forced to go to my bank and provide them documentation about the non sufficient funds to figure out what was happening and I also printed out a statement which shows I had money in the bank at that time. 

After further review, my representative then noticed that the date the collection agency attempted to withdraw funds was listed the XXXX of XXXX and not the XXXX of XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had agreed upon. My representative then spoke to the collection agency to ask why they were attempting to charge me non sufficient fund fees as well as threaten to sue me if they had attempted to withdraw funds on a date that was not agreed upon. The response that he received was truly exasperating. 

The collector XXXX stated that we had n't agreed upon the XXXX but the XXXX. He claimed that to have it in by the XXXX it had to be withdrawn then. That statement was a complete falsehood. Besides the obvious fact that the XXXX was days after XXXX therefore chances are I did n't have money to spend, but it 's also days before I get paid and therefore I would never agree to such a deal. Furthermore, when my representative attempted to play nice and chalk it up to a whole misunderstanding and to offer them the same amount as before which was the {$700.00}, the collector said he could n't do it because the funds had to be withdrawn before the XXXX of XXXX. He also made a statement that the settlement offer was no longer valid. At this point my representative asked for the Supervisor. 

The supervisor was named XXXX XXXX. he tried to explain to her the entire situation. He informed her that the funds withdrawal was according to their own documentation attempted on the wrong dates. He also informed her that I was willing to still pay the agreed upon amount. She would n't hear any of it. Although her tone was very cordial, she simply reiterated what the collector tried to tell me and instead of noticing that they had wronged me and were attempting to wrong me more, she tried to focus on why I was able to afford the full amount and therefore did not require a settlement. At this point they are being malicious and they have broken the law. 

They essentially pulled a bait and switch on me. They lied to me in order to collect more money than agreed upon, attempted to withdraw money when they were n't supposed to, and now they are attempting to extort illegal non sufficient fees and treble damages. 

At this point I am very upset and if they attempt to sue me for these ridiculous charges, I will counter sue. I ca n't believe a collection agency is allowed to operate like this. Please look into them as they should not be extorting people for money. Their job is to collect and not to try and con people out of thheir money",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,1832836

XXXX XXXX then became very pushy and condescending, to get me to "" pay this debt today ''. I told him I will not be paying anything until I received an itemized ledger stating what every charge is, because the amount they said we owed was ridiculously high.

She yelled something into the phone and transferred me to her manager without another word. The manager, XXXX XXXX, was respectful and said she will send out the ledger.

Throughout this phone call he would bark out things like "" go get your debit card! '' or "" pay this debt! "".

She informed me they were not required to send a bill. I informed her I had received a bill for 10 months in a row, that pretty much sets a precedence that they send a bill. That 's when she informed me I was going to have to pay court costs and she added it to my original debt. These people never gave me any opportunity to answer this debt at all, much less the first thing I hear from them is by a summons.

While I was away the debt collector sent my wife a summons to appear for the same case and when she did not appear - the debt collector asked for and received a default judgement that I successfully got vacated. 

This debt originated from unpaid medical claims by an insurance company and I had to enlist the aid of the Illinois Insurance Commissioner to compel them to pay the claims. This took over a year but the insurance company paid on the claims. The judgement amount the debt collector sought to get from the default judgement did not take into account the payments made by the insurance company even though they were aware of the payments that were made. When asked about the payments the debt collector stated "" I have a judgement '' ; however the judge vacated that judgement and the judgement amount was reduced. Has I not sought to have the judgement vacated the debt collector would have sought to collect the entire amount of the judgement knowing that at least half the amount they were seeking had been paid already by the insurance company. 

The debt collector verbally agreed to a payment agreement but sent a form - not filed in the court too late for me to comply with the terms of the agreement. The debt collector then filed the agreement with the court 5 days after the payment was due and then filed a Wage Deduction Notice with the court and sent a copy to an employer that I have contractual relationships with damaging my professional reputation.

None of those steps were followed. We moved, set up USPS mail forwarding to our new address, and continued with life. 
XXXX claims they have sent XXXX bills to our old address. None of them were forwarded. The collection agency sent the collections notice to our current address. 

A XXXX representative gave me the number to their collections department, which went to a different third-party agency than the one that sent me the collections notice. 

The stance from XXXX is "" We did everything wrong, can not provide you with a transcript of our conversations or a copy the recorded conversations with our representatives, so pay up.

I figured that at most we had received 5 days of 31 possible days of service that month, and I sent XXXX a check for 5 of 31 days billing, totalling {$14.00}. This check was cashed by XXXX, but I was billed until XXXX, XXXX 
Furthermore, I called XXXX to pick up their equipment. No one came to the house, and after the XXXX call they sent a postage paid box for me to mail by XXXX their equipment. They received it, and the mailing took place in the XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any receipt for this.

I received the XXXX written notice from the credit collection agency on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On a phone call of XX/XX/XXXX a woman asked if XXXX XXXX sent the cable box and equipment. I told her of my letters of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX setting out my position and verifying that I 'd sent the equipment as they requested. 
I spoke on XX/XX/XXXX to a representative of the credit agency and told her that when a human being from XXXX contacted me, I 'd be glad to communicate with him/her. As far as I know the credit agency has a copy of my original letter of XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. 

The last printed claim against me for this bill from the collection agency was postmarked XXXX XXXX. I have not opened all the printed notices, but adjustments were made, and I am said to owe XXXX {$220.00}. 

I have had up to XXXX calls a day from the agency. Most I do not answer. A recording asks me to verify who I am, and says what the matter is, gives me a reference # and their XXXX phone #.

1063,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"This Complaint is filed pursuant to FDCPA 15 U.S. Code 1692e - False or misleading representations, and 15 U.S. Code 1692f - Unfair Practices : 1. This is for a cease and desist of unlawful debt collections by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. and Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. hereafter SPS Inc. because they are violating the FDCPA, The FCRA and XXXX Georgia XXXX XXXX ; 2. On or about XXXX XXXX SPS Inc. purchased a loan account from XXXX that had been closed 4 years prior to the assignment to SPS Inc. ( See XXXX, proof of closure ). 

3. As a result of the assignment of the closed account, SPS Inc. is now fraudulently calming it has a security interest in our real property on behalf of the alleged trust previously held by Bank XXXX, Although the alleged loan was bought out of the alleged trust effective XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

4. SPS Inc. began reporting to all XXXX credit reporting agencies in XXXX XXXX under a new account number XXXX, and are now attempting non-judicial foreclosure. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Whereas, On or before XXXX, XXXX, XXXX the purported loan account held by XXXX XXXX XXXX in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, loan Number XXXX was CLOSED by XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX proof that the account is still closed as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). 

6. Whereas, the purported loan account has been closed for more than 4 years. Therefore, We dispute the clams made by SPS Inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. for the following reasons : ( a ) They have personal knowledge that Bank XXXX Trustee for XXXX, XXXX does not have standing to foreclose on my property in the state of Georgia since they are not the secured creditor, and ( b ) They have personal knowledge that the loan obligation was bought out of the alleged trust supposedly held by Bank XXXX, as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; and ( c ) They also have personal knowledge that the promissory note they are using as a bases for foreclosure is void after the account is charged-off or closed, and even if it was n't void it DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE OBLIGATION to which they are attempting foreclosing on. since SPS Inc. own the loan they also have personal knowledge that ASSIGNMENTS are not subject to negotiation under the XXXX. 

VIOLATIONS 7. There is an ongoing unlawful effort by SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX to intimidate, harass, and coerce us into giving them a secured interest in our property. SPS Inc. and XXXX are committing the following FDCPA violations. Whereas, ( a ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX Has made, the representation and implication that seizure, attachment, or sale of our property in foreclosure is imminent unless a loan modification is agree too. and ( b ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX Has made threats to take action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken. and ( c ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX Has made false representation or implication that we have committed Civil offences in order to disgrace us. and, ( d ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX are taking nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of our property, and there is no present right to possession of the property claimed as collateral through an enforceable security interest. 

( e ) The property is exempt by law from such dispossession or disablement, and ( f ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX are constantly communicating with us regarding a debt by post card through third parties. 
CONCLUSION When the original loan was charged off or closed, the loan and note no longer exists ( according to UCC requirements ). All that remains is collection rights to default debt. AND, those rights can be transferred by assignment ONLY, and not by "" transfer '' of a negotiable note which is DEAD.

1065,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I previously had an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX, however, I continuously paid my account in a timely manner by way of XXXX XXXX pay. When I received my XXXX 2012 - XXXX 2012 ( service period ) bill ( approximately XXXX XXXX 2012 ) it stated I had an unpaid balance of {$160.00}, so I paid {$160.00} in cash at the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX. located less than XXXX minutes from my residence. I checked my bill pay first and saw that the payment was sent but the check never cashed ( nearly one month after it was sent ). At that time I was most certain the check was lost and would not be cashed. So I called my bank and cancelled the check ( {$29.00} ), meaning I could make the payment and hopefully avoid a XXXX payment that would lead to extended wait time getting my money back and/or "" having a bad mark on my credit report. I also talked to XXXX XXXX prior to stopping payment on this check and let the agent know so my account could be annotated. I wanted to ensure everything was done well, so again after I made the payment through the service center I called back XXXX XXXX customer service and I was assured by the agent that everything was documented within the system. During that conversation I also learned that the reason my account past due is because my account number was changed from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a system update. I then updated my bill pay with the new account number ( XXXX etc ... ) and made the remaining balance payment of {$170.00} through my bank account ( totaling {$340.00} on my XXXX statement ). 
Then came time for me to move ( XXXX ) to XXXX XXXX WA. resulting in closing my account XXXX 2012 ( six months later ). I made my last payment before I left XXXX XXXX confident that all was well and good with my account. I even received check dated XXXX XXXX 2012 XXXX {$7.00} XXXX further ensuring that my account was well and good. However, long after I cashed the refund check from XXXX XXXX on my account I received a disturbing collection 's agency letter stating that I had an outstanding balance on my XXXX XXXX account in the amount of {$190.00}. This amount included a {$30.00} return check fee and {$160.00} unpaid balance. I asked the customer service rep, on-line technician how I can get my log-in and password from the internet and was told ( impossible ) because the account is closed. I also have asked the agents to simply review the system notes on my account to clear this matter up but apparently all the posting that the agent promised she added to my account had been purged from the system. I do n't know why a company would attempt to collect a payment for several months after an account is closed in good standing. Especially, when the system history notes ca n't go back that far and fully see the picture of those time periods. 
Note : My suggestion for their office is to leave notes from six months past on accounts or do n't attempt to collect from old customers that have closed their accounts in good standing. After 6 months has past that should be more than enough time for a company to clarify an account especially when it come to a returned check ( I paid my account and cancelled the check because of an account number change in which I had no knowledge of ). When the bill pay check initially came in it had the old account number on it and must have sat in someone 's inbox until after I had already closed my account and the technician notes were purged from my account.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1377893

I countered that he had XXXX payments in XXXX, and I offered to pay XXXX even payments of {$320.00}. He said that he only got approval for the settlement if I paid it by the end of the month.

1148,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"Complaint against : Select Portfolio Services Address of Foreclosed Property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX SPS Account Number XXXX ENCLOSURES : Verification Letter re : date of original delinquency/Chase Demand Letter to SPS Recently, I applied for a mortgage and was approved. The company in question, Select Portfolio Services ( SPS ) became the servicing agent for mortgage foreclosure that was filed in XXXX, and they took over servicing in XXXX. It is still being reported by them with a date of original delinquency of XXXX I contacted them to let them know that the date of original delinquency predated my dispute by over 7 years and must be deleted. Their response was essentially that it is the date of their last activity, not the date of original delinquency, that determines when the 7 year period begins to run, and that they will continue to report this delinquency until XXXX in direct violation of the FCRA. I sent them a letter demanding that they delete this entry but as of this date I have gotten no response. 
The loss of the home and other substantial assets, like a pension, a job, etc, were the direct result of the XXXX mortgage debacle. I have already suffered enough loss from that. I believe SOMEBODY has to have some relief for me instead of the banks. 
I contacted the original creditor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to verify that the date of original delinquency is over 7 years. Their verification, which I believe is incorrect and I will further investigate, said the date of original delinquency is XXXX. It is my belief that there were several missed payments before that date. Assuming that to be true, any reference to this debt must be deleted in XXXX of XXXX. SPS has refused to acknowledge this and insists that it may report until XXXX. 

I had a mortgage in place a few days ago, but because of this entry, and the false record of the date of delinquency, the mortgage was declined at the last minute and I was unable to make the purchase. Disputes have been sent to reporting agencies and the response was the same. They believe the date is extended by the date they got the account. 
Another factor is that when the started servicing the loan, it was to be under the terms and conditions agreed to by XXXX. Part of that agreement was that XXXX would take a deed in lieu of foreclosure. SPS refused to do so and cause more damages because of the time it took to finally get the property out of my name. 

My concern is not only for my account. If they are following this procedure on all of their accounts, they are undoubtedly reporting countless accounts in error. This is not a clerical mistake. It is their policy and procedure, and it a clear violation of law. They need to stop, and they need to be sanctioned for each and every violation.

1292,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. and XXXX XXXX XXXX are attempting an unlawful nonjudicial foreclosure on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX based upon a void note and void security deed/contract. 

1. The Loan was bought or sold out of the trust identified in XXXX below and was converted to a 30 year fixed conventional loan on or about late XXXX or early XXXX. The transaction by definition was a refinance of the original table funded adjustable rate loan which is classified as predicator per XXXX by Reg Z, to wit ( unenforceable ). See Exhibit XXXX, loan type. 

2. A foreclosure can not legally take place if the deed and note is for a different loan type than the lender/creditor is trying to collect on. The new 30 year fixed rate loan type must be described in the note and identified in the security instrument. it is not, see Exhibit XXXX, XXXX. We have not signed a new note or deed, and did n't actually sign the original deed and note in its current form, ( THEY ARE FORGERIES ) See Exhibit XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the actual illegal signatures of the sales manager of the originator. 

A ) UCC XXXX. If illegality or fraud were involved in the original transaction, it can not be proved that the person is entitled to enforce the instrument. See Exhibit XXXX. &, XXXX ) XXXX XXXX ( b ). A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection ( a ) must prove the terms of the instrument and the person 's right to enforce the instrument. See Exhibit XXXX, XXXX XXXX. A new 30 year conventional note, security deed, and new disclosures documents should have been executed. However, that never occurred. The current deed and note on record, although void by operation of law under TILA and Reg. Z, is still reflecting the old invalid table-funded predatory note and deed and is being used to try to foreclose. See Exhibit XXXX. 

4. In the foreclosure documents, they are intentionally misrepresenting a material fact to justify a foreclosure. See Exhibit XXXX. In the foreclosure documents SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX XXXX is says they are operating on behalf of XXXX f/k/a the XXXX, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWABS XXXX it is a false statement. For the loan to be held in trust, a re-securitization had to occur, with a new XXXX XXXX number per SEC. 

5. No debt is owed to a party on a note and deed arising out of a "" real estate closing '' where there was no loan made between the originator and the "" borrower ''. in other words, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a division XXXX was the servicer and owned the of note at closing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but was not present or disclosed at closing which means no consummation was made.

Also note that the mandatory chain of transfer called for in the "" XXXX '' was not met. See Exhibit-XXXX. chine of transfer. 

6. The loan is rescinded from its inception, effective by operation of law as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX. See Exhibit XXXX. The lender/creditor failed to respond or otherwise defend in a court of law as required by statute. See US Supreme Court 's mandate in the case XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). 

7. The U.S Supreme Court found that Section XXXX ( a ) "" makes no distinction between disputed and undisputed rescissions ''. therefore, to respond in court in 20 days is not left to the discretion of the lender, it is a statutory requirement. 

8. XXXX XXXX, in the unanimous decision said, "" the statute is clear on its face and therefore NOT subject to a judge 's interpretation of it ''. XXXX XXXX also said any attempt to raise "" defenses '' to rescissions after 20 days would, if allowed, render the rescission NOT effective by operation of law until a judge reviewed it.

Please find attached a copy of the lease that appears to have been altered by management and or other personnel at the apartments. 

Please note that the collection agency or the creditor will probably refuse to show you the actual lease because the creditor altered the lease and have therefore incriminated themselves. 

Please note that the creditor has already sent a dossier regarding this case to the NC Department of Justice, and the NC Department of Justice has sent a copy of that dossier to me. 

If you look at the lease then you will see that the creditor simply changed the end date of the lease from XXXX/XXXX/2014 to XXXX/XXXX/2014 without my knowledge and approval. 

Please find attached pictures of what appears to be management and or other personnel at the apartments. 

After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. 

After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel employed by the apartments allegedly took the photographs. 

The pictures appear to show management and or other apartment personnel in the process of I think willfully and intentionally vandalizing the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated from the apartments.

1320,Communication tactics,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I would like to file this complaint against Grant and Weber. The way they have treated me these last 5 months is completely shameful and they have caused me plenty of grief and have left me feeling complete despair. 

I recently found out that there was a judgment on me for my deceased husband 's medical bills. I became real ill because I have no money. My mother saw this and said she would give me money to try and settle this debt. Because of this, these last 5 months I have been attempting to settle this old debt that my deceased husband left me with. Grant and Weber has the judgment against me and my deceased husband. My husband died many years ago and I am XXXX years old and have been living on nothing but social security for many years. I have n't worked in nearly 20 years. The only thing I have left of value is the home my husband left me with. 

5 months ago I initially communicated with an XXXX XXXX about this account and she told me that this judgment was {$11000.00}! Upon hearing this I was mortified. The original amount owed to the hospital was {$4700.00} dollars and even after reviewing the documents there was only {$800.00} in attorney fees. When I spoke with her she said that they wanted {$9500.00} and nothing less. 

Upon hearing this I was distraught. I do n't have any money and I ca n't come up with {$9500.00} so I decided to talk to someone who may be able to assist me. I spoke with an individual named XXXX XXXX who attempted for months to negotiate with Grant and Weber. He spoke with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, another individual named XXXX, and an XXXX XXXX. They kept giving him numbers until XXXX XXXX finally told him {$8500.00} bottom line. Now when he calls they say they do n't even have records of that number. How convenient. 

During these last months I have borrowed money from my mother, from my feonce, and have sold many possessions I held dear just to try and come up with the amount I was told. In the end I came up short. I was only able to acquire {$7200.00}. I have nothing left to give and no one else to ask for money. When my representative called to offer that amount is when things with Grant and Weber got ugly. 

Had Grant and Weber simply said no I would have been OK with it. Distraught but OK with it. What I am not OK with is the things they said. I heard the conversation XXXX XXXX had with the representative and I was appalled at the way XXXX XXXX XXXX dealt with this matter. Truth be told, he was very cordial initially but towards the end he said some very hurtful things. 

In the conversation, XXXX XXXX XXXX implied and then later stated that I could beg for money to pay this bill. As a 64 year old woman living on social security I was very hurt at the notion of being told to beg for money. He also stated that I was offered {$50.00} a month years ago to pay this debt and that is why they would n't lower the amount. That 's not true. Furthermore, he wanted to make an example of me. He stated that they would n't lower the balance because he was "" calling my bluff '' whatever that means. he also stated that "" he does not reward people for not paying promptly. '' He even gave an example of how when people go get a XXXX XXXX credit card you do n't get rewarded for paying late. 

This debt is from my husbands medical bills right before he died. I was solely dependent on him and I do n't have money to pay them with. I do n't know what all the laws for collecting are but you should not be able to belittle people by saying they should beg for money to pay their bills. Also, they should n't be punished now simply because they could n't pay their bills in a timely fashion when they were completely destitute. I understand this may not help me in the settlement, but these people should not be allowed to disrespect and belittle people in their time of need.

1347,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"For several years I have been trying to resolve a collection account with National Credit Systems. The collection account was originated by XXXX in XXXX, NC. Please see the attached copy of emails which describes the problems encountered. 
Due to the problems encountered at the XXXX with an infestation of XXXX, the Complainants were offered an early cancellation of the lease by the apartment manager onsite at the time without any fees or penalty. The Complainants accepted the offer and proceeded to move from the apartment. Apparently, later senior management decided to renege on the manager 's offer, and after the Complainant left the apartment they sent the Complainant a bill for the early cancellation of the lease. 
National Credit System, the debt collector, was allegedly contracted to collect the account. The Complainants had sent several letters to the debt collector explaining the situation, but the debt collector ignored the letters and continued to try to collect the alleged debt without verifying the Complainant 's information. The debt collector has not excised adequate due diligence to determine the validity of the account they are trying to collect despite request to so by the Complainants. The Consumer Financial Protection Board has stated in court case that the FDCPA "" grants consumers a legal right to truthful information in their dealings with debt collectors, '' the CFPB said, citing the Supreme Court 's XXXX ruling in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

The debt collector in the Complainants case is in violation of the FDCPA as indicated by the CFPB due failure to provide the Complainants with truthful information. Furthermore, the alleged debt is prescribed by the North Carolina statute of limitations which states that a contract, obligation or liability arising out of a contract, express or implied, '' is three years in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). In addition, the debt collector is listed as an inactive debtor collector by the North Carolina Department of Insurance. As such the debt collector is trying to collect an alleged debt without a valid license as required by the State of North Carolina and in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. XXXX which constitutes a felony. See citation below. 

The debt collector has engaged in unfair and deceptive acts, in violation of Regulation AA, by trying to collect a prescribed alleged debt and by providing a negative credit history to the credit bureaus to force the Complainants pay for debt that is not owed and a tool to collect a prescribed debt. This practice is also in violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act which prohibits creditors from providing false and inaccurate information to a credit bureau. The debtor failure to conduct adequate due diligence to determine the accuracy of the debt they are trying to collect after gaining knowledge of the disagreement with Apartment management and continuing to try to collect resulted in violation of the FCRA. The debt collector ignored the Complainants rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and purposely ignored the information provided by the Complainants with the willful intention of inflicting financial damage to the Complainants. 

The Complainants in good faith recently offered to pay an amount of up to {$200.00} for the nuisance value of the debt 's collector action, but without accepting the alleged debt, however, the debt collector did not respond to the offer. However, the offer was made before the Complainants became aware of the debt 's collectors illegal practices, unfair and deceptive acts and practices, violations of the FDCPA, and North Carolina debt collection laws and criminal violations.

They also try to get me to pay them what I owe right then and there so I would not get served with the fictitious papers. Of course, I have never been served and my wages are just fine. I know these are all scams so I ignored them. 

The other day I returned a missed call on my cell phone. The area code was XXXX, which is XXXX, New York. I returned the call because my husband just transferred his GI Bill to me and I am trying to use it for XXXX school, so I believed this numbered belonged to the Regional VA office that is in fact, in XXXX. Instead, it was a no-name debt collection office saying that Cashcall has referred my past due account to them because I owe them {$8100.00} on a loan I took out 3 years ago. I did not take out a loan 3 years ago. 

Once more, I was told my wages will be garnished and I 'm having papers filed against me and I will be served. The woman I spoke with told me that they have already attempted to serve me with papers multiple times at my old address, which is my parents ' address, which has never happened. 

Although I am very confident this is a scam, it has n't ceased, and as someone who was once in a poor financial situation, it makes my XXXX every time! I am really at my wits end, and I can not imagine how many other people experience this, and how many other people actually actually pay out of fear. 

These people obviously know that I previously had a loan from Cashcall and now using this information to prey on me. All of their claims are absolute nonsense, but it still makes me extremely nervous. 

The phone number I called was ( XXXX ) XXXX.

I am moving out of state to start a XXXX and care for my aging parents. I needed a forbearance for 3 months until school started as I would not have any income to make payments after I moved and prior to my new program. I contacted my lender 2 months in advance and asked what was available. Even knowing I would not have a job BUT that my income would resume ( I have documentation attesting that I have a salaried position beginning when I start my XXXX in the XX/XX/2016 ), they informed me that I would have to pay or have my credit downgraded. I asked about partial payments, interest only payments, and any other programs. They pleasantly informed me that there was nothing they could do. I have worked XXXX for ten years, getting paid much less than my counterparts doing work that is intended to assist those who can not help themselves. Even still, my credit is near perfect ; I have not missed or been late on payments ; and if I have an issue I have always contacted them to adjust payment due dates, etc. I have been a good customer and want to pay what I owe. The fact that I can verify my future income and have an excellent payment and credit history has not made a difference. 

Additionally, a couple of years ago I joined the military and was XXXX XXXX for XXXX months. Prior to and during that time, I tried to work with the lender to have my payments reduced, postponed or suspended while I was away. Eleven months later I received notices from my lenders that I was approved. I had continued paying up until that time because I did not want problems with the lenders or my credit because I had not heard from them. So my SCRA benefits were effectively unavailable to me. Now when I asked to use the time I was approved for that I did not get to use because of their unexplained delays, I am told that it is too late and I should have used it then. How is that possible? I can not use what you do not make available to me. I am not going to incur irreparable harm because of their failures. This is unacceptable.

If I was of a different mind, I would let it go and never bother to pay them, knowing I have a job and a house and a car and can get around having negative credit. These backward and aggressive financial practices does not do the economy or our current and future workforces any good. We never should have bailed out these companies, especially since, when we need bail outs, ones that we can guarantee we can pay back, they are unwilling to help. As a taxpayer, consumer, and productive citizen I should get at the very least what these businesses get. There is no justice, no equality, no protection for me.

1435,Taking/threatening an illegal action,"See Letter written to Senators XXXX & XXXX as well as Representative XXXX when he was in office : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo Home Equity Executive Office XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern : RE : Payment for Acct # XXXX I am FURIOUS!! I received a call from a Wells Fargo representative on XX/XX/XXXX as well as today RE my home equity loan that was supposedly in arrears. I told both representatives to be sure that call was recorded! I subsequently went to my local Wells Fargo branch in XXXX today, and was assisted by a teller named XXXX who was filling in because the manager was "" on leave '' and no assistant manager was available. 
There is a 10 day grace period, and I have always taken advantage of it. I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX, and the last day for the grace period was XX/XX/XXXX. The representative to whom I spoke on XX/XX/XXXX informed me that it takes 5 DAYS for the payment to be credited to my home equity loan. My husband personally spoke to the branch manager the week of XX/XX/XXXX, and the impression he got that was that I would receive no calls as long as payment was made by the due date VS the end of the grace period. T his is the 2ND time I have had a similar issue with Wells Fargo -- the last episode was in XX/XX/XXXX. In both situations, the payment was made BEFORE the end of the grace period. It also turns out that in both situations, the payment was incorrectly credited to another home equity loan that is just about paid off. 
What I really found offensive was being asked if I was in arrears on my primary mortgage during the XX/XX/XXXX conversation. Additionally I had to verify my employer of 31 YEARS as well as my home address where we have lived since XXXX. This information had to be verified AGAIN during my conversation with XXXX XXXX today. He could not have been more courteous given how irate I was about this situation. 
XXXX who looked into the situation @ the local branch had suggested that I call the number on the payment coupon to speak to a supervisor. That was a mistake as well. Before I was allowed to be put through to the supervisor, XXXX XXXX, I was asked the SAME questions that I had verified 2-3 hours earlier!! When I had spoken to XXXX earlier, he made reference to notes that had been made during the XX/XX/XXXX conversation. Could this woman not have looked @ the same notes and assessed that I had already given that information?? This lady told me my voice was raised, and I agree it was because I was FRUSTRATED with the interactions I have been having with telephone representatives of your bank. I was FUMING!! I did apologize to all to whom I spoke. I informed them that I understood that they had to do their jobs. No expletives were ever used either. 
How can Wells Fargo justify taking 5 DAYS to clear a check for a Wells Fargo home equity loan that is drawn on a Wells Fargo account that has PLENTY of reserve to cover the amount of the check?? Furthermore, I pay the loans at the branch where I have my checking account. 
It seems that Wells Fargo wants to go back to the banking practices of XX/XX/XXXX. During that time, I worked as a private duty nurse to get through grad school, and the personal checks with which I was paid took 10 days to clear. My husband and I were living on a shoestring back then. I thought those antiquated banking practices went out the window, but obviously they have not. 
I am fortunately in a position to pay my bills and to pay additional principal as well. Unfortunately, in this economy, others are not. I feel HARRSASSED by your policy of doing automatic calling when payment is past due but within the grace period. I am sure that Wells Fargo as a lending institution takes advantage of any grace period extended to the company.

Back in XXXX, I went through a financial hardship, and was having difficulties maintaining my mortgage payment and keeping up with credit card debt. I had no choice but to walk away from our home and all debt. As a consequence for my financial irresponsibility, my credit score dropped all the way down to XXXX and stayed there for over 7 years, making it very hard for my wife and I to purchase things like automobiles, a new home, or get any type of new credit. 

At the XXXX, nearly 7 years later, most of that bad debt started to drop off of my credit report as a result of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) rules and regulations. Through secure credit cards and other means my credit score started to improve ( XXXX ). 

Then in XXXX XXXX, while logging into my credit monitoring account ( XXXX ), I noticed that my credit score had dropped significantly. It was the result of a new default judgement showing up as a public record. Here are the details of this judgement : Date Filed : XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Reference # : XXXX Court : XXXX CO Magistrate Plaintiff : XXXX XXXX XXXX Amount : {$3400.00} I was never given notice of this lawsuit, nor was I ever served.

When making the telephone call to cancel ( close out ) my BOA credit card I told the woman I talked with that I wanted to sever all contact with BOA. She replied in the affermative that it would be done. Then said that in the event that a charge should appear I want it disregarded and no charge for insufficient funds as my account was closed. She had to talk with her supervisor about this. After this consultation she told me that it was okay. No further activity on my account would occur. I am absolutely positive about this conversation. Am not so sure about the following. 

Sometime thereafter I received a charge from BOA. Believe the charge was for insufficient funds. Believe that I called BOA and told them of the arrangement concerning my account closing. I may have received an additional bill by mail but did not receive any more invoices. 

I assumed that everything had been settled with BOA until I was turned down for a credit card with XXXX XXXX Bank. Got a credit report and found the negative entry from BOA. Before cancelling my BOA credit card I had previously cancelled ( closed XXXX my bank account. This account was closed because they made errors, one very significant.

My civilian job has been very helpful and has worked well with me and my family with the transitions, up until this point, that is. The attached documentation is in chronological order and I will try to explain it in this letter in the same manner. 
The first letter I received was dated XX/XX/XXXX and it is telling me I have a debit of {$1700.00} in unpaid health insurance. I elected to pay for and maintain my civilian coverage while on XXXX XXXX to allow my family to keep our same providers and use my military insurance as secondary coverage. It states in the letter that my payments are scheduled to be taken out of my check and that I would maintain the pretax benefit with that. I elected to let that procedure take place as outlined in the letter. I was back at the USDA from XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ; I then went on XXXX XXXX for XXXX more weeks from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. I then returned to the USDA on XXXX XXXX XXXX and stayed there until I was activated on the orders that I am on now ; XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received the attached letter from the Treasury Dept. that stated I owed {$660.00} and listed a website and a telephone number. The website seemed suspect to me and was asking for all my personal information, so I called the phone number on the letter and left messages there, with no response. The letter also stated on the top my debit was {$660.00}, but at the bottom payment coupon it says I owe {$850.00}. I contacted my supervisor at the USDA and he contacted one of the USDA PR personnel that are located in XXXX. They both advised me to wait until they checked it out to make sure it was legitimate. 
Next, I received a phone call on my cell phone from Pioneer Credit (? ) asking if I was who I am, what was my birthdate, address and last XXXX of my SS. Of course I was very wary of answering, but then he told me my last XXXX! He wanted me to send them a copy of my orders and I told him the USDA had copies of my orders and if they sent him to me, they can give him copies of my orders. This is what rekindled my efforts at finding out what is going on, so I contacted my USDA Supervisor and the USDA PR person. The PR person sent me the information attached dated XX/XX/XXXX that outlined my medical insurance payments and what is still due. On page XXXX it states I owe a principle of {$630.00}, interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00}. After I obtained this information I mailed a {$500.00} check to the Dept. of the Treasury in XXXX XXXX with the attached XX/XX/XXXX letter. I will mail them the remaining amount when I find out if I am liable for the full amount. This brings me to one of my questions ; Am I responsible for the interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00} or does the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allow for these charges to be waived because they were incurred while I was on military duty and they are trying to be collected while I am again on military duty? 
But the main reason for my contacting you, is that I visited my banks yesterday and was told that this incident is appearing on my credit report and causing damage. Again I need to ask ; does n't the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act prevent my credit from being damaged because of this?

I was shocked by the aggressive behavior of this person and told him We have already paid for our visit and gave him the details of the payment. He was not ready to listen to me and again threatened me reporting this to show on my credit history. I thought this is a Phishing call. I called up my wife at work and we made a conference call to XXXX XXXX billing and asked them if we owe them anything. They said we did not. We than called up RCA and found out the bill was raised by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( hence forth abbreviated as XXXX ) another entity working within XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We called up XXXX billing office, spoke to XXXX, she said they sent us the bill to our address, which we never received. On further questioning we found that XXXX erroneously sent the bill to Apt XXXX instead of Apt XXXX. We updated them with our medical insurance information and the correct address and requested them to send us the bill for payment. We never received any bills. 
On XXXX XXXX XXXX we moved from XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I received a call from XXXX XXXX of RCA at XXXX Hrs on XXXX XXXX XXXX. I again updated our new mailing address to him and asked him to send us the bill. 
The issue is the same, XXXX XXXX XXXX had sent a bill of $ XXXX for collection to them and if I pay it off on the phone now they will not spoil my credit record. 
we called up XXXX billing office once again today at XXXX hrs, spoke to XXXX ... ( last call made for the same purpose on XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX ). Updated my insurance details once again and our new address, and requested her to send us the bills and call off the collection agency. XXXX said she can not send us an email, however she will send a communication to Renton Collection Agency to stop harassing us. 
We tried making a conference call XXXX XXXX XXXX of Renton collection into a group call with XXXX, however XXXX XXXX did n't want to continue the conversation when he heard that XXXX XXXX XXXX are on the telephone line. 
In XXXX XXXX we received a letter from XXXX saying they have cleared an amount of {$260.00} on XXXX XXXX XXXX from a billed amount of {$380.00} billed by XXXX. We needed to pay {$46.00} as co-payee. 
I called up XXXX billing office Spoke to XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX hrs and once again for the third time updated our address for them to send us the bill of {$46.00}. They say they still have no record of our address change and they have sent our bill for collection and they no longer can accept the money and I should talk to RCA. 
I called up RCA spoke to XXXX XXXX of RCA at XXXX Hrs on XXXX XXXX XXXX. Asked him why we were not raised a bill for the due amount of {$46.00} after they were paid {$260.00} by the XXXX insurance on XXXX XXXX XXXX, this is in spite of us giving RCA and XXXX our Billing address. XXXX XXXX informed me I should pay {$88.00} immediately by phone to him and he had already reported us as defaulter to credit reporting agency XXXX to be placed on our record.

I was on a month to month contract, but, to simplify my life I just paid it annually in advance each year. The last renewal bill I did not pay. I switched alarm companies in XXXX. That same month I got a call from XXXX XXXX asking why I did not renew. I told the supervisor why and he stated he was sorry and asked what he could do to keep me as a customer. I told him I already switched XXXX and there was nothing. He said he would get back to me with a proposal anyway, I said fine, just email it to me. 
I never got that email and therefore did not even think about it.

They are claiming I owe {$330.00} for alarm services. Then I got to thinking about what happened. I had some questions. 1 ) Why are they charging me for almost a full year of service? 2 ) Why did n't the supervisor tell me this on the phone in XXXX when he knew I was with another company? 3 ) How long does it take to cancel a service for non payment? 
I called XXXX XXXX and they said they do not have the records anymore I have to deal with the collections company. 
I sent certified letters to the collection agency ( attached ) trying to resolve this and they are refusing my offer. I offered paying up to the time in XXXX that I spoke with the supervisor even though I feel I owe nothing. I think it is more than fair. I now understand that they require an advanced written notice to cancel. I think the supervisor had an obligation to notify me of this when I spoke to him on the phone.

He was not on the account and not being a cable subscriber unacquainted with the rigors of account management for this type of service. He was told that he could n't cancel for her so he told XXXX that he would stop payment. The bill was being auto-paid from her bank account and since he is on XXXX bank account when the XXXX/XXXX/15 payment of {$78.00} went out of her account he stopped payment and had the funds restored. On XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX pulled XXXX from XXXX bank account and my brother had that refunded the next day. 

I got involved XXXX/XXXX/15 and in a compromise attempt tried to do a name change and reduction of XXXX to internet only. I refused to pay the amount they wanted for internet after cancelling phone XXXX and was pretty clear about that. XXXX actually spoke with them at this time and they claim the I was added to the account then but when XXXX handed the phone back to me the line was dead ... the call had been dropped. Knowing we could n't call them back directly we waited for them to call us back. They never did. 

Numerous calls later the account has been turned off as of XXXX/XXXX/15 and we have been sent to collections for approx. {$200.00}. I disputed the collection amount and charter has reviewed the case and credited us {$40.00} leaving a balance of {$150.00}. 

We feel like we delivered the message to turn XXXX off over and over and pretty clearly ... even if not by their requirements. My brother should have been helped to meet their requirements rather than antagonized during the XXXX call. Or if I was on the account as they claim they should have called me. 

We would like XXXX to honor the XXXX/XXXX/15 cancellation of service date. I am not sure if that would reduce our bill to {$0.00} or not but we tried and tried and tried again. they finally honored our request but quite some time later.

XX/XX/XXXX we were XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, because of all the issues of moving furniture and weight restrictions we decided we would sell our furniture and buy when we got back to the states.. XX/XX/XXXX we were XXXX to XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Texas, The kids needed furniture so we decided to go to a local furniture store ( Home Design ). The sales person was very nice and helped us pick out the perfect set for our need at the time. The sales person informed us of a credit company they were working with had a deal where we would not have to make any payments for 24 months. The only thing was that the credit company they were going through only allowed a {$1000.00} limited so we had to get XXXX credit cards totaling XXXX. We agreed and in a week we received our furniture and everything was great. Since we were not new to getting credit, we understood that interest rates would accumulate, so I called the company about a month later to ask about my account information and mailing address so I could send my payments and not accurate interest rates. The customer service person at Synchrony Financial informed me that they were not allowed to give out my account number over the phone and that they would send me a bill soon. A month later I called again and they still refused to give me my account number and stated the same thing that a bill would arrive soon and that I could start making payments. To make a long story short I never once received a bill. As time went on I knew they would send me a bill once I started to accrue interest. Well Instead of getting a bill I got a call from the collections dept at Synchrony Financial offering a settlement. I explained to them what was going on and we came to an agreement that I would just pay it and get it over with. The last time I heard from Synchrony Financial was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter from XXXX XXXX telling me I owed them {$970.00}. I immediately called synchrony Financial and had them send me a letter stating that I had paid off the loan and that I did not owe anything. They agreed to send me the confirmation letter. Seven days later I email XXXX with the statements and a letter of XXXX balance. XXXX does their investigation and confirms that I still owe XXXX, and I am stumped. XXXX informed me that the XXXX that I had paid to Synchrony bank was for the XXXX credit card and all the interest that was accrued. At that point I asked them to send me all the statement so I could see for myself. I expect to receive the statement XX/XX/XXXX. 
Well since we had gotten back to the States my wife and I have been working hard to get our credit scores up so we could buy a house. Two months ago my credit score was finally above the requirements for a VA Loan, so we decided to put a down on a new home. Just as we were about to settle on the mortgage this collections comes out of nowhere. We have n't gotten a rejection letter from the bank yet but they were asking about a late payment I made XX/XX/XXXX, I am pretty sure they are going to want to know how I thought I was going to get a mortgage with a collections company on my credit report. 
I have taken out some loans in the past that had some bad interest rates and but this is a whole new level of sneakiness that I just did not see coming.

In my email to you of XXXX stating the details of this case I listed five separate contacts we had with the XXXX Customer Service personnel ; each time we were told "" Do n't worry, the account balance is XXXX, there was a system glitch. '' ; but each time there was another bill from XXXX for the same discontinued service. This has now gone on for 14 months, and still continues. 

It is a simple matter for XXXX to verify that there has been no activity on the lines in question since the original service cancellation, they have usage statistics for all digital lines ; thus, there is no basis for these continuing debt claims, and the XXXX Customer Service people seem to be aware of this. It should be quite clear that there was an accounting error. 

The fact that the XXXX Collection department keeps repeating this claim, evidently in hopes that I will simply give up and pay, just to avoid further nuisance, amounts to harassment. Is this really so hard to get resolved? Is this not what the CFPB was created to deal with? Please try once more to get this stopped, for good.

XXXX and XXXX were informed that we were recording the phone call. 
In the state of Nebraska, it is a Class III misdemeanor to violate the Fair Debt Collection Practice Act. The following will provide detail regarding the aforementioned statutes and offenses with RSC and it 's debt collection representatives, XXXX and XXXX.

My physician, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, who has been my doctor since XX/XX/XXXX, recommended this lab because of the broader range of testing they perform. 
I informed XXXX XXXX that my insurance plan requires that I utilize lab services at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for coverage. He assured me I would not be responsible for any charges even if my insurance did not cover these services. He had previously explained this in similar fashion to my husband who used these services. Our insurance may a partial payment and the lab wrote-off the balance, as was stated to him by XXXX XXXX and the laboratory on the day of the blood draw. 

When I reported to the lab 's local draw-site I restated my concerns of coverage before any XXXX and was reassured that I was not responsible for any charges, and that I would not be billed. XXXX is part of my XXXX and is covered by insurance. The collection date was XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, received the above noted letter from Monterey Collections and I immediately called them with the previously stated explanation. The representative made the statement that the doctor sent me there because he receives a kickback from the lab ( her statement, not mine ) and regardless, I still owe {$2400.00}. She also stated that the sales reps lie and asked if I had the statements in writing, which I do not. I was told by my doctor that the lab takes what insurance pays and there is no further charge. I had no reason to believe my physician was not being truthful. I am quite sure he was told by this laboratory that this was their policy. I went to this lab in good faith, and furthermore, I checked with them again on their policy at that time and I was told the same information. If there was a policy change, it should have been posted at the laboratory draw center and I should have been informed at that time. 

In my opinion, I believe I am a victim of fraud. Fraud in health care is defined as an "" intentional act '' of deception or misrepresentation. I very clearly stated my concerns regarding using this lab and was reassured that I would not be responsible for any charges. Furthermore, I never received any bill for this service until now, 16 months later, and that bill is from Monterey Collections. I have additional concerns that my credit rating will be tarnished and this may affect my ability to transact business in the future. I am extremely concerned my good name has been potentially damaged.

1712,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I attended XXXX University between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to earn my XXXX and a XXXX. To finance my education, I paid with a mix of federal and private loans, as well as my personal finances. My private loans were issued through Wells Fargo Bank ( although I had come to Wells Fargo through XXXX ). After applying for my loans, I never received any correspondence from Wells Fargo. I was given no account information to view my loans online, and even when I tried to track this information down online by entering other personal information, like Social Security number, birthdate, first and last name, their online system could not link me to any account ( which I find odd considering almost every other banking institution can retrieve your account information from your personal information filled out in your account applications ). 

Having never taken out student loans previously, I was not completely understanding of how the process worked. Since my loans were then issued and distributed through XXXX University 's financial aid office, I did n't suspect any issues or negligence on the part of the bank. 

My loans will soon fall out of their grace period next month, and after having still not been contacted by Wells Fargo, I called to find out any information. In speaking with several loan service officers, I learned I DO in fact have an account number, which had never been given to me through any correspondence. I learned my mailing address had been incorrectly recorded in their system, and so I had never received any snail-mail correspondence that would have provided information to access my online account. 

I was never emailed nor mailed ANY statements notifying me of quarterly interest payments, which I could have been making ( and DID make on my federal loans ) during school. 

I have now accrued nearly {$10000.00} in interest that I was never notified of, and the bank accepts culpability for mailing loan disclosure agreements to the wrong address and for also failing to EVER correspond with me through email so that I could access my online account. 

I understand from the XXXX XXXX XXXX 's XX/XX/XXXX article ( XXXX ) that Wells Fargo has been under investigation by the CFPB, so I am submitting my case to help further this investigation.

XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXXComplaint Description : The National Credit Systems , Inc. states that I owe on account # XXXX a total of {$3600.00}. The account in question is from an apartment that had an agreement terminated XX/XX/XXXX. I discovered this debt by checking my credit report and inquiring about it. On my credit it shows as debt owed beginning XX/XX/XXXX, however it should be changed to the correct date of XX/XX/XXXX. No attempt has ever been made to reach me regarding this debt that began XX/XX/XXXX. I had cosigned for an apartment for a friend of mine and was never notified of the failure to pay a debt. The person who rented the apartment, informed the apartment management that she was unable to afford the apartment and that she would be terminating the agreement early. She was told that if she left within three days that she would only be charged the early termination fee of {$2400.00} and no other fees. She left within three days per their agreement and made an arrangement to pay {$100.00} per month until the debt was paid off. In addition to the deposit on the apartment that paid off {$220.00} toward the termination fee, she made one payment of {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX and did not make payments afterward. Once I found out about my credit score I called National Credit Systems to resolve issue. They state that instead of the {$2400.00} ( minus the {$100.00} payment and the {$220.00} deposit ), we also owe {$1200.00} for less than 60 day notice, pro-rated rent at {$32.00}, {$180.00} for cleaning charges, {$3.00} in damages, and {$19.00} in water/sewage which brings us to a total of {$3900.00} ( minus the {$220.00} deposit ). We should not have to pay the {$1200.00} for not giving 60 days notice as the arrangement with management was to leave within 3 days to avoid these charges, and she met that arrangement. In addition to the complaints, I have contacted this company and was met with extreme hostility. They yell over me when I merely ask questions regarding this debt which is news to me. They hang up on me frequently. They are rude, condescending, and insulting. At this point, when I call them they simply put me on hold until they eventually hang up on me. The company agreed to consider the debt settled at XXXX % ( {$2500.00} ), and yet when I asked for that agreement to be made in writing prior to payment, they refused saying that I must take their oral agreement and nothing else. I do not trust them to keep their agreement without seeing something in writing. To reiterate, I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the three credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously. I would also like the agreement they made with me at considering this debt settled at XXXX % to be put in writing prior to payment.

I immediately called Sallie Mae to discuss my hardship in hopes for a solutions due to my promptness in attempting to sort out the issue before I end up in financial trouble. 

In the first phone call Sallie Mae simply informed me that they have no options for me at this time and my only option is to default on my loans and that at that time collections may have more options for me. 

Unsatisfied with this solution, I called a second time and in that call I was told that they can offer me an interest only payment for 12 months, essentially delaying my monthly payments not adjusting the actual amount in any way. In doing this it reduces my monthly payments in total by about XXXX dollars, however, the total payment due is still not affordable. 

So at this time, they will not consolidate my XXXX loans, they will not lower my payments every month, they will not work with me to prevent going to collections and defaulting and my only option is to default on my loans to get assistance.

I went to the yard ( XXXX XXXX ) and signed the ownership of the vehicle so they could sell the car. I was told that that would satisfy the cost of towing and storing the Car. 

I recently realized that after selling the car, XXXX XXXX also submitted a Claim to Credit Bureau Associated for Collection. The Claim is for {$2600.00}. I contacted CBA collection who stated that CBA only sold the car for {$70.00} and they want the difference. I told CBA that is ridiculous, that the hubcaps were worth {$70.00}. CBA stated that XXXX sells all of their vehicles for {$70.00}. 

So then it is clear. This is a scam. I sign over the car and they sale it claiming they only received a nominal amount for the car ( {$70.00} ). They keep the cash tax-free, then sale the account to a Collections to get more money. I told CBA that I want a copy of my file including a bill of sale showing who they sold the car, what date, what amount as well as all other documentation. 

They have not sent me this information. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX to remove this fraudulent collection and they refused. Please help with this matter.

I contacted them, inquiring what the bill was for, they advised me that they are attempting to collect a debt for XXXX. During the call, I said the charges do n't sound right and why after 7 months am I just hearing about this from a collection agency. I gathered the information about who and why the debt was being collected so I stated I will seek advice from and possibly hire an attorney. 

I did seek legal advice and was advised to request a physical breakdown of the bill sent by mail, as it is my right to have that information, advised to give no further information or answer any questions, and also request a freeze put on my account so no further interest would be accrued. I then contacted Hunter Warfield a few hours later. Hunter Warfield rudely declined to send me the bill and also declined to put a hold on accrued interest while I wait for the physical documentation. She said that she ca n't help me because I said the trigger word, "" attorney '', in my first call and I refused to say if I had representation or not. 

Everyday for a few days I would call and was declined to have my bill sent to me, due to my account now being "" marked '' for saying "" attorney ''. For the next month, a couple days a week I would call and ask for a copy of the supposed charges be sent to my address and kept getting declined, hung up on, and some of my calls where ignored. I know the calls where ignored because instead of ringing for a full 30 seconds or being put on hold it would instantly go to voice mail, this would be right after I had talked to them on the phone and refusing my requests for information still. I also did leave voice mails requesting the information be mailed to me. Finally, after about 5 weeks, I contacted Hunter Warfield and was told they will procure a copy of the bill from XXXX and mail me the information. About 4 weeks later I received a "" Notice of Additional Time Needed to Provide Verification of Debt ''. In this new letter they have finally suspended collection activity and credit reporting.

Looking back, I wish I had kept the eviction notice, kept a log of all times and dates, and made a record of all evidence. I digress, mainly because its good to get a better idea of the whole situation. 

So, this is where the situation currently resides. A few months ago when they refused to send me a copy of my bill I was going to submit a complaint because this whole situation is ridiculous.

When I respond that they are getting money thru the Credit Counselors, they respond that they have refused the offer. I remind them that they are accepting the money and tell them that that is the best that I can do.

I know this for a fact because the banker in the XXXX branch offered the {$20000.00} I needed, then inquired about my specific XXXX, which I declined to answer, as is my federal right, but saw my XXXX.

Consumer was not notified of debt collection through current contact credentials and XXXX did not respond to disputes relating the the debt. As a result, the debt collection method, as well as the debt validity, is invalid. 

I. Consumer Properly Cancelled Her Gym Membership at XXXX, Because She Gave Forty-Five ( "" 45 '' ) Days ' Notice of a Geographic Move Greater than XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) Miles Away from XXXX. 

Under the XXXX Membership Agreement Terms and Conditions Section 2 ( C ), "" [ y ] ou may cancel [ the Membership ] Agreement by providing forty five ( 45 ) days ' written notice in person at the XXXX or by certified or registered mail for any of the following reasons : ... C ) If you move your residence more than XXXX ( XXXX ) miles from any health club operated by Seller ( must provide satisfactory proof of new residence ).

As previously stated, Consumer 's contract cancellation was effective on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Consumer paid final membership dues of {$180.00} on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, for membership through XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

After I ask to speak to her supervisor the one that will be reviewing my request of the stopping of the garnishment she did tell me that she does not take calls and that she will make a notation that I did not want to provide the information that she asked for I then proceeded to tell her I did not say that and that what I did say was I do not have what she is asking for her to assume that I have child support of which is not a guaranteed income even if I do have an order that that should not be considered because I ca n't guarantee that every month I 'm going to get that money every month even in the hardship letter I let them know that I one point I was working XXXX jobs but due to health care issues that I have I could not continue to work both jobs so I quit my XXXX job my question is why is it okay for your company to to have a system that misleads Borrowers when they have accounts with you but your system tells them that they do not so you would have borroers assume that they do not have an account I did ask so when was the last time anyone attempted to call me at the phone number that I have on file which is active I asked when was the last time someone tried to call me XXXX advised XXXX was the last time she seen so I 'm trying to understand what policies and procedures you have because at this point those are deceptive practices to have an automated system that does n't give accurate information leaving me open to garnishment when I could have easily set up a payment plan or rehab plan the same way I did with the Department of Education I feel as if the department handling my account does not want to help me can not account for the questions that they are asking me.,Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,2219525

XXXX XXXX would not disclose how much I owed on the account nor would he provide a settlement amount. He did however keep insisting I use a credit card to charge a settlement amount to them.

Besides, that was something worked at the time of cancellation, not otherwise. 
Where do I raise the flag and think about this being a fraudulent tactic and something to bring to the attention of the authorities and for an audit not only of my account but other accounts? 
When in a conversation with other office workers at lunch they told me they had a similar issue once they cancelled the account and something like {$23.00} was the amount owed after a final audit. Since it was a small amount the paid it and forgot about it.

Plain Statement of FactsDefinitionAlleged Lender now is Bank of America N.A .

8.

I got in touch with XXXX and explained to them my desire to discontinue our telephone service. ( I 've had this telephone for over 40 years. ) XXXX said that they could remove the phone line but they would only credit our monthly service bill for only {$4.00}. Our bills indicated that XXXX was charging us {$30.00} per month for just the telephone service. Due to length of time we were clients, we were no longer under any kind of service contract with them. We decided that XXXX was only interested in bilking us for service we no longer wanted or needed. They were also providing us with a very slow internet speed, a service they no longer, in fact, provided to new clients because, "" It was too slow ''. My wife and I decided that it was time to leave XXXX because we no longer felt they were being ethical or reasonable in their business dealings with us. We found another XXXX who would provide excellent service, at a charge far less than XXXX, and treat us with respect and honesty. We ceased using XXXX services on XX/XX/2017. 
I called XXXX to discontinue service with them and return their modem, which I did immediately. At the very end of my conversation with the service representative to close our account he told me that XXXX would charge us {$150.00}. for a disconnection fee. I have been with the company for over 12+ years, we did not have a current service contract with XXXX , nor any written or verbal agreement that there would be any disconnection fees applied to us whatsoever. I asked XXXX to provide proof of this "" contract ''. They never provided proof of a contract as they promised to do. Is this their way of conducting business with long-term clients? 
XXXX followed up by only sending us a non-itemized bill in an attempt to bury this fraudulent charge inside our final bill, without ever providing us with any proof of our responsibility for such a contract charge. They are not being ethical in dealing with us. 
They have not sent the proof we requested, but instead have turned the matter over to a collection agency. We absolutely dispute that after over 12 years service we were still under a "" contract ''. This is a false claim on their part. Plus they are not furnishing us with a bill that itemizes and dates all charges. I find this a rather unsavory way to conduct business, especially with a long-term client. 
Yesterday, we received a letter from a collection agency working for XXXX without any itemization or explanation of charges. Just a final bill amount, without any documentation, nor "" proof '' of a "" contract '' which XXXX claims we had, but will not show us. How can we know what we are being charged for? We were also informed by a XXXX telephone agent over 6 months ago that we were "" no longer under any contract with them currently ''. 

How do we go about having this {$150.00}. unsubstantiated charge for disconnection by XXXX dismissed? XXXX refuses to deal with this matter in a civilized way. 
They are demanding payment for something that they have not provided evidence of. This is unprofessional and arrogant on their part. We have always dealt with them in an ethical manner, they are not responding in kind. 
In my research on XXXX on the web I 've noticed that XXXX has a multitude of lawsuits against them for their poor business practices all over the USA.

We received notification that the fax succeeded. We also sent a letter to them as well. Lastly we have filed a complaint through the attorney generals office. We are also prepared to file a civil suit demanding that wages that have been garnished, be repaid, if it is n't stopped immediately. You can not go around illegally garnishing wages through illegal procedures. Our attorney says that we have a very good case and that they are in violation of the fdcpa as well on how they went about collecting this debt. If they want to contact me, they can.

XXXX seems to be unwilling or unable to deal with this matter effectively ; now it has been turned over to debt collection agencies. This matter has gone on for so long without results, despite repeated attempts to deal with XXXX, that more effective action is required. 

The history is as follows : 1. We terminated service on XXXX account number XXXX XXXX XXXX for telephone and internet service in XXXX XXXX CA on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. An automatic bank payment arrangement was cancelled on XXXX XXXX. Both cancellations were confirmed in a telephone call with a XXXX XXXX of XXXX on XXXX XXXX. We opened a new XXXX ( telephone and internet ) service on XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX CA. 

2. On XXXX XXXX I received a bill for {$130.00} which included billing for another month of the XXXX XXXX service which had been terminated. In a telephone conversation with "" XXXX '' of the XXXX Customer Service dept. we were told the charges will be removed, it was caused by a "" system glitch ''. 

3. On XXXX XXXX I received a bill for {$120.00} which again included billing for the terminated XXXX XXXX service. Another telephone conversation with "" XXXX '' : "" do n't pay, a corrected bill will be sent. '' 4. In a new bill, dated XXXX XXXX I was again told I owed {$100.00} for the terminated service. Another telcon with a XXXX XXXX of XXXX on XXXX XXXX : "" All charges are removed, your balance is XXXX, a final bill will be sent by mail. '' 5. A letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX Credit and Collections ( re account XXXX XXXX XXXX, as above ) states : "" We recently sent you ... Failure to pay the outstanding balance on your bill by XXXX XXXX XXXX may cause your account to be referred to an outside collection agency. This could result in reporting your debt to the credit bureaus which may affect your credit standing. "" Please pay, etc. 

6. A letter, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX, from debt collector XXXX XXXX, XXXX informing me that the bill for {$100.00} had been referred to this collection agency. Please pay, etc. 

7. A XXXX on XXXX XXXX with a XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX Customer Service : "" The balance is XXXX ; ... with the next bill - XXXX - this will show. Do not worry about the debt collector, he will be informed by XXXX. '' 8.

'' Amount due : {$100.00} ; on XXXX XXXX Account no. XXXX ( sic ; note the difference from the no. in item 1. ) It is not credible that XXXX Credit and Collections Office is simply not aware of these cases, there must be many of them. It appears to be a practice of theirs to ignore the customer service inputs, and keep pursuing these settled cases in the expectation that they will eventually just give up and pay anyway, to avoid the nuisance and the repeated threats, and particularly to avoid a credit record problem. There seems to be no deterrent to them for such practice. 

These repeated attempts to bring threats by debt collection agencies, long after the original issue has been resolved, in fact amounts to a form of harassment and intimidation, and may even amount legally to a form of extortion. It needs to be dealt more effectively than simply by more letters or emails. The CPFB needs to get involved.

What practices are off limits for debt collectors? 
Harassment. Debt collectors may not harass, oppress, or abuse you or any third parties they contact. For example, they may not : use threats of violence or harm ; publish a list of names of people who refuse to pay their debts ( but they can give this information to the credit reporting companies ) ; use obscene or profane language ; or repeatedly use the phone to annoy someone. 
False statements. Debt collectors may not lie when they are trying to collect a debt. For example, they may not : falsely claim that they are attorneys or government representatives ; falsely claim that you have committed a crime ; falsely represent that they operate or work for a credit reporting company ; misrepresent the amount you owe ; indicate that papers they send you are legal forms if they are n't ; or indicate that papers they send to you are n't legal forms if they are. 
Debt collectors also are prohibited from saying that : you will be arrested if you do n't pay your debt ; they 'll seize, garnish, attach, or sell your property or wages unless they are permitted by law to take the action and intend to do so ; or legal action will be taken against you, if doing so would be illegal or if they do n't intend to take the action. 
Debt collectors may not : give false credit information about you to anyone, including a credit reporting company ; send you anything that looks like an official document from a court or government agency if it is n't ; or use a false company name. 
Unfair practices. Debt collectors may not engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, they may not : try to collect any interest, fee, or other charge on top of the amount you owe unless the contract that created your debt - or your state law - allows the charge ; deposit a post-dated check early ; take or threaten to take your property unless it can be done legally ; or contact you by postcard.",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,2019745

Early termination fees of a contract agreement rightfully discontinue is a contract dispute not debt for services or goods provided. This is a civil matter not a collection matter.

A number of years ago, a distant relative established an identity utilizing my middle and last names with alternative residence, identification, and social security information. He was then able to secure credit, a residence and even an on-going vehicle loan. I have worked diligently to have these items removed over the years. As often as I have been able to, I have contacted creditors to have statements and accounts forwarded to me for legal purposes and to contest debts. There is a fraud affidavit affixed to my credit report, as well as other protections to prevent new accounts from being established. Now Roquemore & Roquemore is calling threatening my family members and demanding that the location of a vehicle be disclosed. I reiterate that this is not my account, I do not possess this vehicle and we have no contact with the family member that committed the fraud. The fraudulent social security number ends in XXXX, which is NOT my social security number. When I attempted to call and explain this, the representative presumed that I was lying and became livid and started screaming. I asked that they provide me an address where I could submit proof of this being a case of fraud, yet she threatened that continued calls to my family, landlords, employers and the like would continue if I did not provide the vehicle. I have promptly called an attorney and had them to draft a cease and desist order. They ( Roquemore & Roquemore ) have made no efforts to validate this debt, or it would become blatantly obvious that they do not have my true social security number or name.

2308,False statements or representation,"I 'm filing this complaint because Ditech response was so disingenuous. It is very easy for Ditech ( Green Tree ) to clear this up, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Green Tree made very clear, they are not obligated to accept payment arrangements other than those outlined in the contract ... ... That letter states there 's a contract. I want to see it. If there is n't a legal contract to support the loan modification we need to start talking about damages. When I read your ( ditech 's ) response, this is what went through my head. 
1. Are you saying we had a "" rental '' agreement on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, but before I received anything in writing I had to give Green tree {$10000.00}? Please explain. 
2. Are you saying Green tree ( Ditech ) rights under the security agreement give Green Tree ( Ditech ) the authority to turn the discharged mortgage into a Rental agreement? Please explain. 
3. Are you saying I was so desperate I would pay rent on your rental unit plus pay green Tree 's property tax and pay interest on the rental? Please explain 4. Are you saying you disclosed an agreement that disclosed I was a renter? Please explain. 
5. Are you saying the money 's disguised as loan payments were part of the settlement agreement? Please explain. 
6. Are you saying a one-sided response to the state of Michigan in XX/XX/XXXX means anything? 
7. Are you saying that Green Tree ( Ditech ) is standing by these statements that the discharged note and mortgage is our agreement? Please explain. 
8. Are you saying part of the agreement was agreeing to make payments in order to retain the property or was it collateral? Collateral means ownership. A home owner 's policy was required. Please explain. 
Without a contract to support Green Tree 's actions, it appears that thousands of dollars was taken under a false pretence. Anything that happened before XXXX XXXX, XXXX is misleading because Green Tree had already foreclosed and became a landlord by creating this rental agreement, which looked like a mortgage agreement. I am respectfully disagreeing with your interpretation of our agreement. I would never agree to an agreement that required me to commit fraud. ( Buying Home Owners Insurance for a rental ) By requiring a home owner 's policy for the rental property has to raise some skepticism. 
For the record, the reason there was a settlement agreement, Green tree threatened to evict me. Green tree choose to sell me the home at market value, rather than a trial by jury. The settlement agreement was just a sham. Green tree was trying to collect {$250.00}, XXXX with the fake rental agreement but decided to sell the home in the settlement for {$150000.00} .... I could have closed on the home the first month of the settlement agreement. All that had to happen was verification of payments. Rent or mortgage payments. Green Tree would n't call my payments rent nor mortgage payments. That should raise some skepticism. 
I requested and received my payment history from Ditech ; all the payment had the appearance of mortgage payments. The Payment I paid during the settlement agreement was not disclosed. I called customer service, they told me it would take about a week to find them, I called the attorney that collected the rent, he told me he ca n't talk to me without Ditech 's permission.

The loan statement was for around {$9800.00} at 11.99 % interest for XXXX months creating a finance charge of {$4800.00}. I assume this was from XXXX XXXX and the vinyl but I had not asked for credit, filled out an application or signed a contract of any kind, signed or agreed to anything with XXXX XXXX, Green Sky, or XXXX Bank, so I do n't know if this is where this debt came from but assume it to be the case. Evidently XXXX XXXX was paid and is now out of the picture as calls to him resulting in him just stating that "" he dealt with a lot of XXXX people '' and offered no help or explanation. 
My issue is I never receive any kind of statement from XXXX XXXX as to the cost of vinyl siding or did I agree for him to put on the vinyl siding on my home. Also, I have never filled out any type of application for financial assistance from XXXX XXXX, Green Sky, or XXXX Bank. I would have never agreed to the amount or interest rate as shown from Green Sky or the amount showing as I am on a fixed income. As a XXXX I had my brother, XXXX, to call XXXX advised send letters to Green Sky stating due to FDCPA I do not owe this debt. They also said that Green Sky had many complaints from the Better Business Bureau. 
I have enclosed copies of these letters I have sent to Green Sky and XXXX Bank stating this debt is not mine and to show me where I applied or signed for this debt. They can not as I never agreed to any debt in this situation. Now XXXX Bank is showing up on my credit report causing my credit score to go down. My brother contacted XXXX Bank XXXX and they stated they had no affiliation with Green Sky and refused to give me their ( XXXX Bank XXXX address. Note : XXXX Bank is on Green Sky 's loan document and now XXXX Bank is on my credit report. I found the home address for XXXX Bank on line and sent them the letter enclosed as well. 
I would appreciate you looking into this matter and stopping this unfair practice I believe to be a scam and have Green SkyXXXX Bank remove this debt from my name and remove it off my credit report.

The account was originally deleted with XXXX, but when the responsibility of collecting the alleged debt was transferred to AMSHER COLLECTION AGENCIES, it was reinserted to my credit file without "" certifying that the information is complete and accurate. "" I contacted the credit reporting agencies to inform them of this mistake, and they advised I discuss directly with the furnisher of the information. 

I emailed the furnisher, AMSHER COLLECTION SERVICES - ORIGINALLY XXXX, the attached letter XXXX XXXX, 2015, requesting the account be immediately deleted. 

I followed up with a phone call to AMSHER XXXX XXXX, 2015. After much time and many transfers, I finally was speaking to the proper customer service representative, XXXX. I explained the mistake, it was likely an administrative error, requested AMSHER immediately delete the account and inform the credit reporting agencies. She stated, "" Since we do not purchase debts, we can not remove them from the credit reports. "" I informed her that this is in direct violation of the FCRA since they are furnishing the information! If they can furnish derogatory information then not only can they delete it, but it is their responsibility to delete it, especially when made aware of the violation of the FCRA ( re-insertion of previously deleted information ). She transferred me to her manager, XXXX XXXX. 

I again explained the situation to XXXX, but he stated that since they recently acquired the debt that it must be valid and therefore can not be deleted ( he stated nothing about not being able to delete it since "" AMSHER does not purchase debts '' ). I informed him that these are significant violations of the FCRA - both reporting inaccurate information and reinserting information that has not been certified to be complete and accurate - and even offered a solution whereby they remove the account in question while AMSHER and XXXX internally resolve the issue. IF they "" certify the information to be complete and accurate, '' then they could re-insert it and be in compliance with the FCRA. How can any furnisher of information reject such a common sense solution that is in compliance with the FCRA? 

I informed him that I am extremely familiar with the FCRA, and I will immediately file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau if he is not willing to delete it as this is an extremely clear case. He told me to "" do what I have to do. "" I request the account be immediately and permanently deleted from my credit file as these violations of the FCRA are negatively affecting my ability to gain employment. Due to my employment application situation and the clear violations of the FCRA, I ask that my request for deletion be expedited.

Home Depot could n't straighten out the problem, could n't tell me why they sent the card to a 15 year old address, and could n't even tell me what was going on. By the way, I had n't had the countertops installed yet and when they were installed, they did it improperly. I went to the Home Depot store in XXXX, XXXX to PAY OFF THE DEBT. The store manager could n't figure out what to do, but I spoke to the CitiBank company via the store 's phones. I CANCELLED THE CARD WHILE IN THE STORE ON XX/XX/XXXX. I tried to pay the ENTIRE debt in full, but the store manager could not figure out how to do that! ( seriously! ) One of the employees said she would "" figure out '' how to do it and I could come back the next day and she would "" have the bill ready. '' I went back the next day and the store STILL did not have my bill ready to pay and the employees spent 40 minutes trying to figure it out even though I told them to simply refund the money, recharge it and let me pay with a REAL credit card ( XXXX ). Finally, they did just that and I paid the bill in its entirety with a reputable company 's card.

Regarding the BAD MANAGEMENT of these apartments, at an apartment complex build and managed by the same company that is building and managing XXXX It appears as though management lied about the amenities that they offered such being a tanning bed and garages. It appears as though management and or other personnel of the apartments did willfully and intentionally alter our lease contract by extending the end date of the contract by one month without our knowledge and approval. It appears as though management and or other personnel photographed themselves as they vandalized the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated at the apartments. After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments photographed themselves as they intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. The management and or other personnel then blamed me for ripping the carpet seams apart and billed me for the replacement of the entire said carpet in the apartment and violating the end date of said lease. 
The same may happen to you. 
During construction you will eat dirt and your car will be covered with dirt. You will constantly head the sound of builders and machinery, and the amenities they promised you will either never be there of be built a year or more later. 
They are petty and rude and have a relationship with a collection agency that will submit your name and social security number to XXXX and other credit bureaus on management 's request.

Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,1884578

I soon fell behind in the payments and most of the card debt was late payments and penalties. Unfortunately I had moved and I forgot about it when I started working again. XXXX XXXX bought the debt years later and sued me. I tried to explain my circumstances, that I was in school and did not make very much money and that I owned nothing. I 'm still driving the XXXX Impala that mother bought me when I was in high school. They refused to listen and threatened & intimidated me into signing an agreement to pay {$75.00} a month which I knew I could n't afford, but I had never had any dealings with the law so I was scared and thought I had to sign it. When I could n't pay it, they sued me. I know I have to pay it and I have been sending them {$25.00} a month but I lost my lease and had to move so I was unemployed again XX/XX/XXXX. I worked odd, temporary jobs during that time and finally found another full time job XX/XX/XXXX but I only make {$11.00} an hour and have been struggling to survive and catch up on my rent since then,. But I started paying the {$25.00} a month again then. But XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX froze my bank account and took my last {$190.00} out which meant I had no money for food and gas for over a week. When I read up on Florida Garnishment Rules, I saw that they are not supposed to be able to garnish a person 's salary if they make below a certain level and that includes their bank account if it can be proved that the money was income. The only money going into my bank account was my salary. I have tried to talk to them several times and even had my mother call them because I 'm not very informed about these matters, but they only say they are trying to collect a debt for their customer and wo n't agree to a lessor payment. It is not for a lot of money, only about {$2500.00} but I do n't have it and neither does my mother. She lost our house to Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX and we have both been trying to recover since then. We ca n't even afford a lawyer to fight them and feel like we are victims of the law and have no recourse against this unscrupulous company. We will pay the debt but we need time.

I called both CPA and XXXX on three occasions. After each contact, I believed that XXXX understood our position and the matter was closed. The last contact was on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to XXXX companies. I confirmed that CPA would be contacting XXXX, and I confirmed XXXX would be confirming to CPA that the matter was resolved. 

I then received notice in XXXX ( XXXX copy included ) that CPA had 'turned my account over to the credit bureaus '.

The first time, I returned call, identified myself, and asked who the debt was incurred with. They indentified a vendor. When I said I had never done business with the vendor ( no company I recognized ), they said "" sorry, we 'll remove you ''. 

Today, several month later, they called again. They left a message with a reference number. I returned the call. After a XXXX5 minute wait, I was connected to a "" XXXX ''. I had to give her the reference number twice. She then asked my name to which I replied "" you called me, so you must know my name ''. She said she would have to transfer me to "" the department that takes care of that ''. After a brief wait, the call was picked up by a man whose muttered his name. I started giving him the reference number, he cut me off and put me on hold, then returned, apologized saying he "" was finishing up with a lady on another call '' ( begging question of why he took my call ) and asked for me to "" repeat the reference number ''. Again, I refused to give my name telling him he must know it from the reference number. He said "" for privacy '' he needed to know my name. He tried several times to get my name, I refused telling him I had no uncollected debts ( note : I do n't even have any past due amounts ). He then asked for my phone number so that he "" could take it off 'the list ' '' begging the question of how would he know that I did n't owe money other than my word? 

Thus, either he was being dishonest in saying that by simply giving my number he would remove it from the calling list ( note : seems strange they would not have a caller ID on incoming calls and my cell phone number 's ID is not blocked ) or that, more likely in my view, he intended to cross reference the number to get my name. Either way, it appears that the "" reference number '' is bogus. Obviously he could have asked "" am I speaking to [ my name ] and then asked me to provide address and phone number to verify my ID.

It was sent to my ex-husband, and I was not aware that it existed until it was sent to collections and popped up on my credit report in XXXX of XX/XX/2012 At that time, I contacted the collection agency to find out what this bill was for, as that was the XXXX time that I had been made aware of it. Because no one ever bothered to inform me that the bill existed, they gave me 30 days to pay the bill in full -- which I did -- and then they removed it from my credit report. I thought the issue was resolved at that time. 

Now, XXXX years later, it appears that the original collection agency sold the debt to a different collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), who is now attempting to extort money out of me for a bill that I have already paid.

2574,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"On or about XXXX XXXX XXXX, my daughter submitted a loan application with Sallie Mae in the amount of $ XXXX to cover the school expenses for her trade school ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX ) that were not otherwise covered through FAFSA. On that same date, I co-sign the loan application and it was submitted back to Sallie Mae for processing. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, my daughter contacted Sallie Mae and found that her loan application was denied on the basis of the co-signer denial. I went out to the Sallie Mae site and saw the denial without explanation ; so, as instructed by their site, I contacted their Customer Service department ( XXXX XXXX ) and spoke with "" XXXX ''. He confirmed the status of the loan application denial, but could not provide an explanation because their "" process '' does not allow their Customer Service personnel from viewing said information ( Oddity # 1 ). He did put in a request through their automated system to generate an explanation letter and that I would see it within 24-48 hours. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was notified via email that the loan denial explanation was out on the Sallie Mae site in my account ( I have a previous relationship with them due to co-signing student loans for my son ). I download the explanation letter and it was the standard boiler plate denial letter without a clear reason for denial ... just listed the potential reasons. Since my credit standing is very good at this point, even better than it was when I co-signed loans with them for my son, I was very confused ; so, as instructed in their letter, I contacted their Customer Service department again. Again, the Customer Service representative could not help me, so she patched me through to the Originator Department and I spoke with "" XXXX ''. XXXX reviewed the account information ; and, as it was with the Customer Service personnel, he was unable to view the actual reason for the denial and stated that this was the process and policy per their Corporate Headquarters. He did submit a request for a full explanation letter to be sent to me via snail mail and that I would see it within the next 30 days. The problem is that my daughter 's school begins in less than 60 days and I explained I could not wait that long, but he said their was no one else he could refer me to expedite the help request. 

I believe the only reason that is causing the hiccup with this loan application is the outstanding $ XXXX in loans I 've co-sign for my son with Sallie Mae, but none of them are delinquent. I state this because my credit is very good, I have no delinquencies and I have a decent income ( $ XXXX ), plus I 'm a veteran and still currently employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 20 years XXXX XXXX, 16 years XXXX ). 

My daughter will be resubmitting her applicable using her grandfather and/or aunt to co-sign for her and those should go through with ease, but I am not satisfied with the multiple layered bureaucracy and the fact that XXXX and XXXX XXXX representatives of Sallie Mae can not assist a customer with a simple task, especially one that could possibly be resolved over the phone.

2651,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I have a private loan with Wells Fargo that I have paid on time religiously for 4 years. The payment is $ XXXX but I always pay {$200.00}. Over the years I frequently paid well before each month 's due date so that I would not forget. Recently, I received an email that my XXXX, 2016 payment, due on XXXX/XXXX/2016, was past due. This was confusing as I 'd made the XXXX payment on XXXX/XXXX/2016 -- after I paid the XXXX bill on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ( due on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ). I do n't think it is unreasonable to assume that, given my history of early payments, and that my XXXX payment occurred after the XXXX payment and billing cycle, that my XXXX/XXXX/2016 payment was intended for XXXX. 

I called Wells Fargo and was told that any payment made 20 days prior to the due date would be counted as an additional payment, not for the next month due. I should be clear again that I did n't overpay XXXX by {$200.00}. I made a separate payment of the same monthly amount that I always had, frequently very early, with no issue at all. I was told that the XXXX/XXXX/2016 payment could not simply be applied to XXXX but had to be refunded. I was then told that, because I do n't have a Wells Fargo checking account, that my payment would have to be refunded by mail, which would take "" a minimum of 3 weeks. '' I was having this conversation with Wells Fargo Customer Service on XXXX/XXXX/2016, 6 days after the XXXX due date. This meant that Wells Fargo 's own process for refunding a payment that should have applied to XXXX would indeed have made me delinquent for the month. Is it fair that a financial institution can structure payments and refunds in such a way that it makes an otherwise responsible and timely customer delinquent on their debts? I raised this question to the Wells Fargo staff who informed me this was "" just the way it is. '' To which I responded with skepticism, saying that this new system was probably just an inventive way of generating late fee revenues in a low interest rate environment. The representative said nothing. 

I called Wells Fargo again today, XXXX/XXXX/2016, to ask about the status of the refund. I was told it would be returned in the same manner in which I paid -- electronically to my non Wells Fargo checking account. This is welcome news but in direct contradiction to what I was assured was the only method of refund just 1 business day prior. Even the representative today could n't explain the change ( which had not been pro-actively communicated to me in any way -- as far as I knew I should be watching for a paper check in the mail in 3 weeks time ). Was the initial response on Friday a way to make me open an account with Wells Fargo that I otherwise would n't have? I have no idea but the inconsistency is as unprofessional and unfair as the initial insistence on delayed paper check refund itself.

Some payments cleared, while others were returned, some payments were returned multiple times. This in turn caused over XXXX dollars in bank fees. Unbeknownst to me at that time, some utility payments, as well as credit cards payments were returned by the bill payment provider. These payments were coded to appear as if it was myself who refused these payments, therefore causing 30 day late to appear on my credit files. Also, I have had a utility terminated due to this, as well as another utility suspended. I contacted my former credit union, to receive a contact number for this bill payment service. Upon contacting this company, the call suddenly terminates without my speaking to anyone in regards to this matter. I had a bill payment service approve payments while there are insufficient funds in one 's account. I have also attached proof some payments were attempted more than twice. According to credit card companies, when a payment is returned, that payment is applied to the balance, unless otherwise instructed. I did not interfere with the processing of the credit card payment.

This is an ongoing attempt to collect a debt, that is not my our own. I have asked them to remove our phone number from their automated system and it still continues as of typing this on XXXX/XXXX/16. Please help as this continues and needs to stop.

2730,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"Unresolved Citibank issue ( {$250.00} ) XXXX XXXX, XXXX {$23.00} was the original amount for an administration fee ( everything else is late fees imposed by Citibank ). 
This was a government issued credit card that was used for official traveling purposes only. 
The training class that I was attending ended a day early so I did the right thing and changed my flight to an earlier one. Upon return, I filed a timely expense report, as required. There was an additional amount charged of {$150.00} and a CTO fee of {$5.00} ( original fare was {$340.00} ). These were all the charges. I have all records. There was no other administration fee at the time I filed my expense report that I was made aware of. If there was I would have included it, obviously. I only became aware of it after I was terminated from this job when I received a letter from Citibank. ( If I was still working there it would 've been an easy thing to amend. ) I immediately contacted my employer. I was told that I did not owe it and they would take care of it. 

XXXX XXXX Received first letter from Citibank for {$23.00} ( this is when I first became aware of the charge ) Called employer ( XXXX ).

XX/XX/XXXX talked with XXXX again. Left messages for XXXX and XXXX. XXXX returned my call and said it should have been paid in the beginning. She said it will be paid by the beginning of the following week but not the late fees! Nothing has ever been paid! 

All along I continued to make calls to Citibank with no luck. I ask for a manager to call me back and he was completely dismissive. He was unwilling to do anything and refused to talk with me. 

XXXX XXXX Citibank has now sent this to a collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ).

As neither the original creditor ( XXXX ) nor the collection agency ( Credit Bureau Services ) has provided sufficient evidence that any damages to the unit were incurred ( before/after photos, work orders for repairs, invoices, etc ), the attempt to collect against me is clearly a predatory practice directed toward young college students whose parents will likely "" cut a check ''.

SPS ' response to my debt validation request was to say that XXXX as trustee for a securitized trust "" owns '' the notes, but my loans are NOT in that trust. I have asked that they at least postpone the sale until they have provided information in response to my concerns. 
SPS, insists that the sale will occur on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX regardless of my claims. 
Their are many issues associated with the standing issue. None of the actions taken against me would have been by the correct party, the Notice of Default, the recording of assignments would all be invalid. 
Legal documents that were used against me relating to bank standing were altered. The copies of notes used to prove bank standing had undated indorsements in blank. In XX/XX/XXXX in response to a QWR, XXXX sent copies of these notes stamped "" Certified Copy of Original Document '' which have no indorsements. 
There are also several serious servicing issues with XXXX and then SPS who was substituted in as servicer for XXXX. When the servicing was moved from XXXX I was in underwriting, at the very end of a modification for both properties. SPS refused to continue the modification that was in underwriting at XXXX. 
SPS has violated many servicing regulations, including Single Point of Contact, Dual Tracking, and the requirement to offer foreclosure alternative solutions in good faith. They send letters saying that those opportunities are available, but SPS has blocked every attempt I have made for a foreclosure alternative. Since they stopped the modification I had in underwriting at XXXX, I have not had the opportunity to utilize any foreclosure alternative. Many servicers are intentionally deceiving and misleading both the borrower and the regulatory agencies, pretending to follow servicing guidelines and requirements, when they are actually trying to sell the property. SPS said they had opened a short sale and I would have four months to list the property and find a buyer. They kept putting me off when I called and then said they could n't open the program because I did n't have a listing. I got a listing which was emailed to them. They emailed confirmation of receipt and said they would respond in writing. They did n't. Then they told me that they had closed out the short sale program because I did n't have "" an offer in hand! '' This entire time, they refused to send me any confirmation in writing that I was actually in the short sale program and continued efforts to sell the property at trustee sale. When I told them they were dual tracking, they said that technically they were n't because "" they had never actually approved the program. '' This is commonly done. I know that I am one of many borrowers who have met with these same experiences. 
Please look into this situation and, if possible, pressure SPS to stop the sale until all issues have been addressed.

The notice informs you that you have the right to validate/dispute the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter.

The letter does not state it has to be sent in writing so why was XXXX trying to force me to send it in writing when I clearly disputed it verbally various times?

The XXXX XXXX apartments are located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX, phone : XXXX. 

Based on my analysis of this situation, I hereby submit this complaint against XXXX XXXX, manager of the XXXX XXXX apartments, and XXXX in the State of North Carolina. 

Here are my thoughts. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel of the apartments did willfully and intentionally alter our lease at the apartments without our knowledge and approval. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel vandalize the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated at the apartments. 

After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. 

After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. 

The management and or other personnel then blamed me for ripping the carpet seams apart and billed me for the replacement of said carpet and violating the end date of said lease. 

Please find attached a copy of the page of the lease that management and or other personnel at the apartments appear to have willfully and intentionally altered without our knowledge and approval. 

Please find attached pictures of what appears to be management and or other personnel at the apartments. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel employed by the apartments allegedly took the photographs. 

The pictures appear to show management and or other apartment personnel in the process of I think willfully and intentionally vandalizing the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated from the apartments. 

Upon my denial of said accusations, management and or other personnel at the apartments ordered a collection agency, Resolve Partners, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NC XXXX, phone : XXXX to collect payment from me for damaging said carpet and violating said lease. 

Based on my analysis of this situation, I hereby submit this complaint against Resolve Partners. 

Here are my thoughts. 

When I refused to pay the collector for damages by management and or other personnel at the apartments to said carpet and what I think was contract malpractice by management and or other personnel at the apartments, the collector referred me to XXXX XXXX, thereby damaging my credit rating. 

The collector accepted this account from the apartments with I think possibly no proof of wrong doing by me.

Just to clarify, I then reiterated the question and I was once again told that I would not receive any fees or cancellation charges if I ported out my phone number and/or closed the account. 

After talking to the representative from XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I ported out my number onto my husbands account within a few minutes as I was standing in a XXXX store and got a new phone.

I have attempted to call XXXX on 4 occasions to get this rectified and every time I am promised that they are looking into it and someone will call me back in 24-48 hour, however I never get a phone call or even an email back despite verifying both. 

Upon receiving the first bill XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX and a supervisor XXXX ( ID # XXXX ), then XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I got the next bill and XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when I received the collection agency alert. I have never ignored any notices and have always been mindful of my account including any charges which is why I called to inquire about cancellation fees prior to cancelling. I request on every occasion that the phone calls be pulled as I know they are recorded, this way the information could be verified. I have been lied to and deceived by XXXX, victimized, harassed, and preyed upon in the hopes of receiving money that is not due to them.

The service provider must state that the invoice will not go into a collection status until the 30-day timeline has been completed, and a specified date must be given to the consumer.

I was informed on Wednesday that one of these companies has obtained a judgment against me and will begin to garnish my wages effective XX/XX/XXXX, defying the laws of the state that clearly spell out that debt that is older than 4 years old can not be collected. These aggressive debt collectors have made it a mission to enforce debts that are barred by the statute of limitations.

2891,Disclosure verification of debt,"As per my correspondence received XX/XX/XXXX concerning my dispute with the University of XXXX . ( SEE ATTACHED DOC ) How can an invalidated debt become a charge-off? 

I am in dispute of this charge-off. A charge-off is a notation on your credit report indicating that the original lender has written off the charge as unlikely to ever be paid. An account that is 120 to 180 days past due usually will be charged off. In this situation, I find it particularly troubling that XXXX would charge-off a debt at such a stage. ESPECIALLY WITH A {$00.00} BALANCE. ( SEE ACCOUNT HISTORY. 
A charge-off is an internal bookkeeping measure taken by a creditor that requires a concurrent finding by them that they now considers the debt to be "" uncollectible. '' In this case, It is pretty far stretch for them to conclude that this debt was uncollectible when it has not even reached the stage of being reportable to a CRA as a 30-day late, and I never received notification that I owed this debt. 
Charge-offs are required by statute for many creditors when a debt has reached a certain level of delinquency, usually 180 days. The reason for compelling charge-offs is to prevent corporations from overstating their assets, of which unpaid debts are a receivable asset, in their financial reportings, and thus misleading stockholders and others of the financial stability of a corporation. 

Accordingly, I can show any judge that this accounts is inaccurate and that XXXX has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by ignoring my requests to investigate the items. My previous letters -- stated my reasons for an investigation and these reasons were not frivolous in any way. As reported, I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX never received any disbursements ' from the XXXX See Invoice Statement. Generated, by attached emails from My University XXXX XXXX Payment History Financial Aide Account. - I did not receive these funds. Neither were they deposited into my checking account. Please provide a copy of this document, ( Check ) for this transaction that was endorsed by me, that XXXX claims was issued to me in the amount of {$810.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to substantiate this transaction. 
On the other hand, an institution of higher education that reports information regarding a student loan to the CRAs, must report it in a manner consistent with the rules of the FCRA and it must also respond to a request for investigation in compliance with the statute, the FCRA should still protect consumers from inaccurate reporting. Debtors deserve the right to dispute a debt and request an investigation of inaccurate reporting. Allowing colleges and universities to avoid their responsibility as a furnisher would contradict the purpose of this consumer minded statute. 
If this final request does not prompt you to conduct a proper investigation of the accounts in question, and send proof to me of said investigation, I will file a civil suit. for damages. I take my credit very seriously and XXXX 's lack of professionalism and assistance is unacceptable. I am well aware of my rights under the FCRA and intend to pursue them to the maximum.

XXXX is a great company with some issues that they could not repair. They also have a bad return acceptance department as this is the second time they claim not received phones when they have been returned. 

As a note we purchased XXXX or XXXX phones within months in an attempt to correct the false call message to no avail We were left with no alternative but to switch services.

Of course, later, the XXXX billing department said I was not covered and demanded {$2500.00} for XXXX visits, all charges worked up for the XXXX XXXX doctor 's visit. I offered to pay the amount of my typical deductible, which was refused as payment. They required me to submit to their disputed bill department, which I did, to no avail.

I never heard anything back from the doctor 's office after that nor did I get any information from the insurance company stating that I owed any money. Shortly after that visit I moved to a new address and never received a bill from the insurance company or the doctor. About one year later, I was checking my credit reports and I find XXXX entries of collection on my reports. XXXX was from PDQ Services Inc and the other was from XXXX but with the PDQ Services address and information. I immediately called the doctor office and was told that there was nothing they could do and that I would have to call PDQ. I immediately called PDQ and offered to pay the bill in order to get it off of my credit reports as I did n't want my credit tarnished from a {$230.00} bill. PDQ was paid via credit card online. After that I still noticed that PDQ had the information on my credit report and I told them that I thought this violated my privacy rights and HIPAA as it showed my potential medical condition. I asked that the entire credit line be removed from my reports as it was paid and served no purpose based on the fact that I never received a notice of a bill. Neither PDQ, XXXX or the credit reporting agencies wanted to listen to my plea. I honestly feel that I have been taken advantage of and become a victim of shoddy medical collection practices. I also think that the doctor never attempted to contact me as this could have easily been paid in the early stages if only I had been contacted. I asked the credit reporting agencies to verify the methods and they basically gave me a nonchalant answer. They claimed to have verified the collection but could n't have as PDQ and the doctor sent me a letter stating that they were not going to address my complaint. Everyone ignored my pleas after I paid the account and all they wanted was their money. They had no concern for my rights as a citizen. The credit reporting agency says that they mask reports when sending out medical information but I am inclined to disagree as I see poor reporting from them each time I look at my credit reports now. PDQ does not bargain in good faith and should have never had my medical information in the first place as they have no business associate agreement with the doctor. I asked for this but it was never given which leads me to believe that they are handling sensitive information without a need.

Shortly after the discharge I received information the lender was claiming I was over {$10000.00} in the arrears I contacted them regarding the discharge and they said the previous company that was managing my account had made an error. They were suppose to send me a letter telling me how they resolved the issue. Now a year after the discharge they are saying I am over {$8000.00} in the arrears even though they show I have made all my payments. The problem is that the current payments are being applied to months that were discharged in my bankruptcy. This is the second time I have had to contact them regarding their misapplication of payments and they just do n't fix the problem. I received a letter of mitigation which is usually the first step before they try to foreclose.

2972,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"After being determined to be XXXX by the Dept of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) effective XX/XX/XXXX, I stumbled upon the fact that the law authorized me to apply for a discharge of my student loans ( FFEL Consolidated Loans ; originated on XX/XX/XXXX ). I made that application to XXXX of the Dept of Education on XX/XX/XXXX and it was approved as XXXX, by XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. From there it went, supposedly to the Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority ( UHEAA ) for further processing. I was notified in XX/XX/XXXX that I would receive a check for {$4000.00} for my effective date of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. The first scam I noted was that the XX/XX/XXXX date was changed to XX/XX/XXXX because I had made my monthly {$170.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called UHEAA they found the VA paperwork of XX/XX/XXXX stating that the "" ... VA verifies my effective date of XXXX to be XX/XX/XXXX '' and told me to call back. The UHEAA employee I had talked to and who had found the official VA letter was n't able to verify that anything could be done to correct any possible mistakes since XXXX 's computer data showed the effective date of my XXXX to be XX/XX/XXXX ( Note XX/XX/XXXX and NOT XX/XX/XXXX ). Where XXXX got this date is beyond my comprehension. I called XXXX and talked to one XXXX ( twice I talked to the same XXXX ) and this nasty and mean employee of XXXX refused to offer me any assistance since all the paperwork had been forwarded to UHEAA for processing and there was nothing she could do to clear up XXXX 's XXXX on my effective date. She wanted me to quit calling and hung up. I then sent email 's to both XXXX and UHEAA with the copies of the pertinent VA letter ( s ). Yesterday I received from UHEAA letters stating that they 've received my XXXX application and it appears to be proper and they were going to forward the paperwork to XXXX for further processing. This entire process I have endured has caused me mental anguish which plays upon my "" panic attacks '' and these attacks are part and partial of my XXXX. I hate to be considered a whiner but this bureaucratic attack on my intellect and my XXXX is willful and absolutely unnecessary. XXXX and UHEAA appear to be in a collusion to deny any ex-student large portions of the funds that are due the veteran/ex-student for over payment. I have, on hand, records of all my personal checks and/or the dates of the automatic payments made to UHEAA as the collection point for the consolidated loans and the difference between what they sent me in a check ( {$4000.00} ) and what I actually paid is over {$11000.00} for I paid over {$15000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX ( I am missing about 6 months of payment records but can easily acquire them from the bank ). This form of emotional abuse heaped upon me by XXXX and UHEAA is a knowing and intentional conduct directed at me, a vulnerable adult, resulting in my suffering mental anguish, emotional distress, degradation, and confusion. I can see how easy it can be for a bureaucrat of either agency to make a tidy sum through the years cheating a student by "" mistakenly '' withholding portions of the funds due the student for over payment and that portion is paid to the bureaucrat ( s ) rather than the student.

We attempted to set up a regular schedule, and, new to the workforce, she did her best to meet the loan payments. We helped as we could to offset the payments. Since 2004, we have consistently received letters and harsh, demanding phonecalls, sometimes threatening, even though we know the amount was regularly late, but paid in accordance with her and our pay checks.

Even the credit card companies have been willing to work with us on consolidating and paying off a card. We have attempted numerous times to talk with the Iowa Student Loans, now Aspire to consolidate and make it easier for our daughter, and now us, to repay the loans. They are unrelenting, offering no options and constantly sending letters and telephone calls. We know the loans are being paid, however, if they are off by only a few days, even due to holidays, the phone calls and cautionary letters arrive.

We understand that the mortgage instrument is a statement that real property is collateral for the faithful performance under the note. If the maker of the note fails to perform then the collateral can be sold to satisfy the balance due on the note. But without a valid note that memorializes the terms of the debt, the mortgage is collateral for an obligation that does not exist -- - unless the note is improperly sold to an innocent third party who pays value, in good faith without knowledge of the maker 's defenses. That bona fide third party is protected under the law. 
If the maker executes an instrument that is defective in some way by reference to parole evidence ( outside the assertions made on the note ) then the third party can enforce the note against the maker despite the existence of otherwise valid defenses of the maker of the note. For anyone other than an innocent holder in due course, the burden is on them to prove that the note was merged with the debt. 
So the questions that we need to be answered are these since the issues have not been addressed for those who have pursued foreclosure have used legal presumptions in a twisted way -- - arriving at the conclusion that a debtor need not know the identity of the actual creditor in order for the obligation to be enforced.Our title concerns are that according to the documents provided by Bank of America N.A, is being researched almost monthly so questiondid you hear or see any evidence that identified the party to whom the payments from the borrower were forwarded?

Southwest cant verify either nor did they mail anything to my home, because my contract for storage or signed information with that company does not exist and after agreeing to me he would send he then changed his course and lied stating that he mailed out thirty days ago.

I saw the company name through caller-ID. I did not answer the call. 

About 5-10 minutes later, my sister ( who lives in XXXX ) receives a call and she assumed it was a family she had been XXXX. She placed me on hold and answered the call. In a few minutes, she returned to me and told me that someone named "" XXXX XXXX '' had called and sternly asked for "" ME '' by name. She told the person that I did not live there, but I was her sister and what did they want? She said the person immediately disconnected the call. Now ... .I DO NOT RECALL EVER, EVER VERBALLY COMMUNICATED WITH THIS DEBT COLLECTOR AT ALL ... ..NEVER. So, there is no way they would have access to my sister 's phone number and I have never, ever used her name for any ; absolutely any form of business. So, how did they get her phone number? And if they have been calling my phone number over time, what would lead them to call a different number? How did they get my sister 's phone number? 

So, my concern is : somehow, this company was able to tap into my sister 's land-line phone while we were on the phone at the time of their call. I do n't lknow how they did it, but this truly happened and they should not be allowed to get away with it. They clearly had a way to do that which is invasion of privacy and by doing so, exposed a personal issue of mine to my family member, who had no prior knowledge. 

I am offended ; I feel violated and I am fed up with the constant harrassment I have been receiving from this company. They should not have a right to do this to anyone ; even if they did owe them money.

3018,Disclosure verification of debt,"On XXXX I had a Seller account with EBAY, in good standing. Due to health problems, I could not continue selling my products on EBAY, with the inability to pay a balance of {$140.00}. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, all my debts, including the {$140.00}, were discharged on Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy Court. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, ( XXXX years later ), after having resolved health and financial issues, I decided to sell small items on EBAY again, but found the account was suspended because of an unpaid account balance of around {$140.00}. 
I proceeded to call EBAY by phone Customer Service to solve the suspension issue. According to the Accounts supervisor, XXXX XXXX, I was not authorized to be an EBAY seller any more because my account was suspended due to unpaid fees. 
I explained XXXX XXXX about the Chapter XXXX discharge, but he insisted that "" The bankruptcy filed is not the cause of the suspension it is from the fees ''. 
XXXX XXXX said I could open a new account, however, he contradicted that it would be problematic, because it will be link to my suspended account. 
In other words, EBAY has no problem at all with the Bankruptcy discharge. They are for ever penalizing me for suspension of fees on my records. 
Bottom line, there is no way I will ever be able to open a seller 's account with EBAY no matter what. 
XXXX XXXX was not able to provide me with copy of EBAY Sellers policies regarding the matter in question. 
I would like the CFPB to investigate if EBAY is complying with the Consumer 's Federal Laws. 
My opinion is that there should be no problem in opening a new fresh Sellers Account, without having the burden of an eternal negative suspended record. 
The Chapter XXXX gave me the opportunity to put in order all of my finances. Now, I have an excellent record in the Credit Bureau, including a good standing with several Creditors and want to start new with EBAY.

Thank YouFrom XXXX XXXX, today, XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

About our phone conversation SR # XXXX ( XXXX ), This is XXXX XXXX, eBay Customer Service Supervisor. As what we have discussed about your question in creating a new eBay account. 
You can freely create a new eBay account at the same time our system is designed that if XXXX or more accounts are related to each other then those account will be linked. Since this account ( XXXX ) is currently suspended then this account may be linked to the new account. The bankruptcy filed is not the cause of the suspension it is from the fees. The purpose of the bankruptcy filed was to offset the charge meaning we are prohibited from collecting the money from the account. And because your eBay account was suspended prior to the date you filed for bankruptcy eBay is n't required to reinstate the account.

3049,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"By letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, and received on XX/XX/XXXX ECMC has issued a "" Notice Prior to Wage Withholding '' for the amount of {$71000.00}. ECMC does not provide "" Attachment A '' to the letter. The letter states, "" See Attachment A for a list of your loans subject to administrative wage garnishment. '' Without being properly served, I can not respond appropriately to this letter. However, I suspect that this relates to an issue that I have been continuously dealing with since XX/XX/XXXX when I sent ECMC a "" Cease and Desist '' after they improperly contacted my employer multiple times. Since that time, I have demonstrated how I paid for my education ( which I did not have the burden to do ), and I have filed complaints with the FTC, CFPB, California State Attorney General, two Senators and my local police. ECMC previously attempted to utilize an invalid document to attempt to claim that I have a student loan. The document did not have my signature, listed fraudulent information, and did not have the name of ECMC or any financial institution ( lender ) or guarantor anywhere on the form. The form was not an original, and the scan clearly reveals a form of media manipulation because the lines are not even straight. The dates are also completely inaccurate. Further, the amounts that ECMC claims far exceed the tuition for the time I attended graduate school : {$26000.00} for the entire program. It 's unfortunate that tuition has skyrocketed and outpaced inflation for the current generation, but using today 's dollar figures and attaching them to XX/XX/XXXX is just absurd. Although it is challenging to take any of this seriously, the fact is that ECMC will again go on to contact my work, and I am mired in a process in which I can not get them to leave me alone, even though I have responded to the shifted burden of proof in this country and demonstrated that I DO NOT OWE anything. The burden of proof should require debt verification and validation on ECMC 's part, but yet again, here we are with their incapability of providing a proper mailing. I have an existing "" Notice of Intent to Sue '' for the State of California, and I intend to go to court over this matter. I fundamentally believe that ECMC needs to be investigated for financial fraud. I do not know why this organization has my information, and I do not know why they are creating fake documents to attempt to harass me and my employer. I work for a XXXX, and we do n't have time to be dealing with this for several hours each week. At first, I just wanted this to stop, but now I want compensatory and punitive damages. After all of this time ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ), the individuals working for ECMC have still failed to provide a legal debt instrument. To now include a letter stating that an attachment is included that is n't does n't seem like a mistake to me. I WANT THEM TO INCLUDE ATTACHMENT A IN RESPONSE TO THE CFPB.

3074,Dealing with my lender or servicer,"My Great Lakes, servicing my private student loan for XXXX student loans, is holding on to my Student loan repayment for interest while they send me on a wild goose chase to provide proof of the checks that were sent. I qualified for a military Student Loan Repayment Program ( SLRP ) in XXXX. The SLRP required my lender/loan servicer ( Great Lakes ) to send out a form with my account number, verifying the amount I owed. After several hours on the phone in XXXX and XXXX XXXX, I found out that Great Lakes sent out the form with a wrong account number ( form is attached signed by a Great Lakes Research Specialist ). They have received checks for just over {$14000.00} at the correct PO Box address since at least XXXX XXXX, but now claim that since the account number was wrong on the checks, they can not apply any payments to my account and need me to provide copies of the checks sent to them in order to find the said checks. The only proof I have that money has been paid is the XXXX I received for the payment. Since the military is such a large bureaucracy it is taking a long time for them to provide copies of the checks. Meanwhile, Great Lakes continues to hold {$14000.00}, which I imagine has been cashed into an interest bearing account, while waiting for me to provide proof they cashed the checks.

3075,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"To Whom It May Concern : Approximately 4 months ago I noticed XXXX accounts listed on my credit. I advised the company who listed the accounts that the accounts are not mine and did not belong to me. I did this via letter sent USPS on two occasions both mailed correspondence included the partial account numbers and my Social Security number in order to allow the company to effectively identify the accounts. Even after sending the notice of dispute and C & D notice to the address the accounts remained on my credit. Additionally the Collection Agency continued listing the account without even notating the account that it was/is in dispute. I assumed after sending the letters in that they would be removed from my credit. I later applied for a loan which I was denied for on the spot. The loan officer sighted the XXXX recent collection accounts as the reason for the denial ( I had no other collections and or past due accounts on my credit at that time ). Once I was informed the accounts were still there I contacted your company via telephone upon doing so I was directed to leave a voicemail. I did so and my call was quickly returned as I threatened suit against your company. The woman who returned my call spoke in a manner that was extremely rude and condescending. In doing so she did advise these accounts were opened out of state by a woman. The accounts were not even in my name. She advised that she would request the accounts to be immediately removed but refused any further settlement to resolve the matter. This in itself was a violation of UDAAP, FCRA, CT Unfair Trade Practices Act and FDCPA. Your company knowingly and willfully continued reporting an account that was not my own without any investigation. I received no response to either dispute letter and was denied credit as a result of your companies negligence.

XXXX XXXX advised this case would generally settle for roughly $ 10,000+ plus attorney 's fees and cost which would be paid by your company. I advised XXXX XXXX I was going to allow your company to freely correct this issue and settle this matter without going through the judicial process if your company was willing to which he advised against. In any event that is what I am willing to do to save from the lengthy drawn out process and extreme cost that would result for your offices. 
I am willing to settle all claims against your company for a one-time payment of {$5000.00} to be paid within 14 Calendar days from the receipt of this complaint or XX/XX/2017 whichever comes first.

More than half a million people may have found themselves in that situation after a new legal filing by the Education Department. 

Under a program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, some student loan borrowers were supposed to be able to have the balance of their student loans forgiven after ten years of both on-time payments and eligible work in the public sector. Meaning, a qualifying nonprofit, federal, local, state, or tribal government. 

The program started in 2007, so the first debt was set to be forgiven this coming fall. 

Last year a small group of borrowers learned that their eligibility for the program had revoked. These include four people, all attorneys, working for the XXXX, the XXXX, and XXXX. 


Student Loan Debt Has Nearly Tripled In The Last Decade NPR Ed A New Look At The Lasting Consequences Of Student Debt Nonprofits like these are not 501 ( c ) 3 charities or foundations, so it may be ambiguous whether they fall under the law 's definition of "" public service ''. But the four argued in a lawsuit last XXXX, joined by the bar association itself, that their status should n't have been revoked, certainly not retroactively. 

They had followed all the necessary steps to qualify for forgiveness. They 'd enrolled in the correct repayment program and filled out an Employment Certification Form with XXXX, which acts on behalf of the Education Department. That form certifies that borrowers work for a qualifying organization or a federal, state, tribal or city agency. It 's suggested borrowers file an ECF every year. 





On XXXX, the department responded to the suit, saying, "" XXXX XXXX 's response to the ECF does not reflect a final agency action on the borrower 's qualifications for PSLF. '' Meaning, in essence, all those years that borrowers submitted certification forms, the department was n't making any promises about forgiveness. 

Technically, the department is only responding to the narrow question about whether this small category of organizations is considered public service or not. However, "" The retroactive aspect of this filing reasonably causes people to be nervous, '' says XXXX, a senior fellow at the XXXX and a former Deputy Undersecretary of Education under Obama, where he was responsible for overseeing the program during its early years. 

Nervous is right. More than half a million borrowers have signed up for the program. So we put the word out to find out how they were feeling. We heard "" frightened, '' "" anxious, '' "" uncertainty, '' "" regret, '' "" betrayed. '' XXXX, who works for a nonprofit providing legal services to the elderly in XXXX, Idaho, has about {$80000.00} in debt. Like many borrowers, she told us, "" A lot of my life-planning decisions were made factoring the loan forgiveness into the equation. '' She says she turned down higher-paying jobs in the private sector, for example. "" I would feel very betrayed, for both myself and my XXXX sons, if this program is taken away, '' she says. "" I would likely end up paying on my loans until I was in my XXXX and would have no ability to save for retirement or to help pay for my children 's college.

3097,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,"I am a recently separated XXXX XXXX veteran. While separating, I had to move out of my house from an allotment called XXXX. 

Many of the damages listed on my move out form were ludicrous, overly expensive, and frankly many of which required a service I already paid for. You see, some things that needed cleaning ( for example, the lawn and the garage ) were not cleaned in time for the final out. Under most circumstances, that would mean that I owe XXXX money to have it cleaned. 

The thing is, I already paid to have a cleaning service do it ; XXXX suggested cleaning service, to be exact. I was guaranteed -- both verbally and documented -- that the cleaning company I hired would be able to guarantee me a passing final inspection. More importantly, I have documentation from XXXX that states that if a job is not completed, they can call the cleaning company back after the final out inspection and have them finish the job. 

According to common law, this grants me Reasonable Assurance from XXXX that even if my house was not completely finished cleaning before the final out, it would be fine, and I would not be charged. However, I was still required to pay the cleaning company {$600.00} for the cleaning, and then more money to XXXX. 

This was only one of many items on the move out report that I was disputing, and I felt like I had a reasonable argument, so I was forwarded to the disputing officer for XXXX. 

I was told repeatedly that because I signed the move out report indicating the total amount owed, that also meant that I agreed to pay all of it. I had already taken the form to the base legal office, and they agree with my interpretation : that my signature on the form does not mean I agree with the charges, and I should be allowed to dispute them. Allow me to quote what it says : "" I understand the items listed above, except as noted. '' I did n't note anything, because I understood it. However, it is not an admittance of agreement, as was made clear by the gentleman performing the final out. 

XXXX continued to refuse my disputes, quoting the move out report over and over. I offered to pay for some of the items, but stood strong with many others as I felt like I was in the right. XXXX never wavered, never tried to find a middle-ground with me ... they just kept telling me I owed them the full amount. 

Then ... they TOOK the money from me. I told them previously that they were absolutely not allowed to remove the amount from my XXXX, as per the Leasing Agreement, however they did it anyway. XXXX stole my money. 

I was contacted by someone higher up in the company, asking to get together for resolution, but I told them that I would not speak with them until my stolen money was returned. They said they would take my response as a refusal to cooperate, and a refusal to dispute the items, so they would simply send the total to a collections agency. 

They also finally gave in and returned my stolen money, weeks later. They never contacted me again about the disputed charges. 

Last night, I received a phone call from a collections agency, regarding this amount. I was informed that I was certainly allowed to pay what I thought I owed, however if it was not paid in full, XXXX would have the authority to negatively affect my credit. 

This is utter nonsense. XXXX refused to work with me on the individual charges listed, despite my numerous emails explaining my position. They took the liberty to steal the money from my bank account, and only then asked me to negotiate the disputed items. After finally returning my money, I come to find that they never intended on discussing the disputed charges, but instead had already filed my debt to collections.
