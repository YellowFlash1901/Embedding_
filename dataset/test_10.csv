0,5162002,"Consumer complaint: I'm filing this complaint today to bring to your attention the recent actions of Flagstar Bank - In XXXX of 2021, I submitted a loan modification packet to Flagstar, after losing both of my parents to covid and incurring a rather large financial setback ( funeral expenses ). My request was assigned to a XXXX  and at that time, I was told that one of the options was a deferment, because FHA loans prohibited the homeowner from reapplying for a modification for 2 years, but that they would review all workout options. 



In XXXX, I called to check the status of the paperwork and was told that it was sent and would be arriving in 10 to 15 days. I was also told that it could take longer because they were behind on the paperwork due to several homeowners in forbearance. I continued to call in for several weeks speaking to several managers and hardship task force supervisors stating the same thing, we are behind in the paperwork from the investors. 



This went on until the end of XXXX when I was told that my deferment was denied back in XXXX, due to the date my loan went into forbearance. I explained my story and how I repeatedly checking the status of the deferment and was NEVER told that it was denied, but nothing was done to correct things Once again, I reengaged Flagstar in XXXX and RE-submitted all documentation. Our file was formally opened for review on XX/XX/XXXX and during the process of review, Flagstar repeatedly gave me conflicting information regarding the status of my request. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that I was approved for a TRIAL PAYMENT PLAN on XX/XX/XXXX and that all that needed to be done was to make the initial payment on XX/XX/XXXX and the plan would be engaged. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them to ask where the paperwork for the TRIAL PAYMENT PLAN was and asked that a copy of it be emailed immediately. When I received the email, the documents weren't for a Trial Payment Plan, in fact, they were for a USDA Farm Loan Deferment Agreement. To date, no one has been able to explain when/who converted my FHA loan to a USDA Farm Loan . This information CLEARLY conflicts with their response to my Modification request in XX/XX/2021 ( where I was told that I couldnt apply because of FHA loan guidelines ). I've requested, numerous times, for a notice of transfer or notice of new service or letter from them and they have refused to provide me with one. 



Not only this issue, but on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by my XXXX that my NEW payment was increased by {$40.00}, due to a recent Escrow Analysis. Further investigation showed that the most recent escrow analysis was performed on XX/XX/2021 PRIOR to the latest approval for workout. NO analysis has been performed since then and, once again, Flagstar seems to be operating on deceptive business practices.",1536

4,6382987,"Consumer complaint: For starters American Credit Acceptance is saying that I don't have any payments made on the car loan for a XXXX  XXXX XXXX  from XXXX XXXX. But if you go to their website and put in the same email address and password that I used to register with you guys, you will see under their transaction history that some of the payments were not returned to my friends who thought I was getting a raw deal. Under their transaction history there are XXXX payments of XXXX which total to XXXX then they are XXXX payments of XXXX which total to XXXX with both of them together total to XXXX and when you subtract from the price of the car there remains an overpayment of XXXX. Since I made two payments with my chase account and my friends all used XXXX  XXXX XXXX they are saying that I didn't make any payments for the car which I did. I expect to receive the refund by cashier check and the title of my car within the next week or two since it shows that they are in complete error of their data unless they are hiding something from me that they are not showing on their website which is fraud that in itself. Please help me out with this. Thank you.",1536
7,1894570,"Consumer complaint: Synchrony Bank did NOT adequately remind me that my promotional "" Zero Interest '' was nearing it 's completion. I set up and fully executed a {$300.00} am month automatic payment AND, here 's my mistake, EMAIL statements, trying to save a tree or XXXX. The combination of automatic payments, email 's whose only subject was "" Your statement is ready '' and human nature, I missed the end of the promotional period. I originally borrowed {$9000.00}, paid it down to {$3600.00} and then they added MORE THAN I OWED in interest : {$3700.00}. I paid two more auto payments before I noticed on the statement that I owed something like {$6800.00}, which was a whole lot more than my Quicken account had on it. Two calls to the company provided no relief. 

It is true that they are within the provisions of the agreement. They won the game. I lost, and yet I feel liked I got XXXX. When I reviewed my email statements, the ONLY place in which they gave me what I presume to be the legally required notice regarding the pending end of the promotional period, was on the statements which I had to open online and were NOT distinguished in anyway. Apparently, the law does not force them to make the "" end of promotional '' statement stand out. This company probably complied with the law but NOT any concern for making me aware of my pending XXXX. 
At the very least, I believe they should be legally obligated to announce the pending end of the promotional period IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. I believe the laws are inadequate in this regard. 

I have the money and will certainly pay it off and close the account, but I 'd sure like a response from someone about this before I do so. I also at least intend to call attorney 's I found online who stand ready to sue this company.",1536

They didn't return any of my money at all. I tried everything I could and tried to cooperate as much as I can, I went to their branch twice as they requested, 1.5hour trip for one way, with my spouse and our 2 type of ID and credit card I used. The last time I visited the branch is XX/XX/21. And then I called more than 30 times, which costs me more than 10 hours, including their branches number, 24/7 customer services, fraudulent department, debit/credit card department, they always push me back and force.",1536
15,2967078,"Consumer complaint: I was mislead by PayPal Credit and forced to pay unnecessary interest. The paypal credit line of credit allows you to make purchases online using the paypal service and your line of credit which gives you a promotional period of 0 % APR for 6 months. If paid in full in 6 months there is no deferred interest, if not, the deferred interest is added to your account for the whole 6 months prior. The monthly statement, in bold letters includes a number that appears to be the amount to pay to avoid paying any interest, however it is really including promotional balances that have expired. this is very misleading, and caused me to miss the deadline to payoff some promotional balances. The misleading statement caused me to pay {$120.00} in deferred interest that I would have avoided if the statement had simply stated how much was due for promotional deferred interest and when it needed to be paid. 

Additionally, PayPal Credit has just out of the blue changed their terms for my line of credit. I don't really care about them making there be a minimum payment as much as changing the interest rate from an already high 19.9 % APR to now 25.9 % APR!!! That is absurd?! They raised the interest rate for no reason by 6 % APR. Considering prime rates have risen less than 1 % in the time this account has been opened a 6 % rate hike is excessive and a unfair to consumers.",1536

First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the exceptional service I have received from your company during my loan tenure. The professionalism and understanding exhibited by your team have been deeply appreciated, and I am grateful for the support I received during the difficult period of financial instability. 
Unfortunately, like millions of other individuals around the world, I experienced significant financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

I want to emphasize that I am a dedicated and responsible borrower who has always prioritized fulfilling my obligations. The financial struggles during this pandemic were unforeseen and beyond my control, leaving me with limited options at the time. 
The purpose of this letter is to request your kind consideration in removing the late payment remarks associated with my account. As of today, I am thrilled to inform you that I have successfully paid off both of my loan accounts tied to Account Number : XXXX. I am immensely proud of this achievement, and it would mean a great deal to me if the late payments tied to this account could be compassionately removed from my credit history. 
Removing these late payments would greatly improve my credit score and financial standing, allowing me to move forward with confidence and stability. I firmly believe that this one-time hardship should not define my creditworthiness or my relationship with ServiSolutions. 
I understand that your company adheres to strict policies and guidelines. Nevertheless, I kindly request that you review my account history in light of the unprecedented circumstances that unfolded during the XXXX pandemic. I sincerely hope you can see the efforts I made to overcome these hardships and fulfill my obligations to the best of my ability.
