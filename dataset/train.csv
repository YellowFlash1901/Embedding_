Struggling to pay mortgage,"I'm filing this complaint today to bring to your attention the recent actions of Flagstar Bank - In XXXX of 2021, I submitted a loan modification packet to Flagstar, after losing both of my parents to covid and incurring a rather large financial setback ( funeral expenses ). My request was assigned to a XXXX  and at that time, I was told that one of the options was a deferment, because FHA loans prohibited the homeowner from reapplying for a modification for 2 years, but that they would review all workout options. 



In XXXX, I called to check the status of the paperwork and was told that it was sent and would be arriving in 10 to 15 days. I was also told that it could take longer because they were behind on the paperwork due to several homeowners in forbearance. I continued to call in for several weeks speaking to several managers and hardship task force supervisors stating the same thing, we are behind in the paperwork from the investors. 



This went on until the end of XXXX when I was told that my deferment was denied back in XXXX, due to the date my loan went into forbearance. I explained my story and how I repeatedly checking the status of the deferment and was NEVER told that it was denied, but nothing was done to correct things Once again, I reengaged Flagstar in XXXX and RE-submitted all documentation. Our file was formally opened for review on XX/XX/XXXX and during the process of review, Flagstar repeatedly gave me conflicting information regarding the status of my request. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that I was approved for a TRIAL PAYMENT PLAN on XX/XX/XXXX and that all that needed to be done was to make the initial payment on XX/XX/XXXX and the plan would be engaged. 



On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them to ask where the paperwork for the TRIAL PAYMENT PLAN was and asked that a copy of it be emailed immediately. When I received the email, the documents weren't for a Trial Payment Plan, in fact, they were for a USDA Farm Loan Deferment Agreement. To date, no one has been able to explain when/who converted my FHA loan to a USDA Farm Loan . This information CLEARLY conflicts with their response to my Modification request in XX/XX/2021 ( where I was told that I couldnt apply because of FHA loan guidelines ). I've requested, numerous times, for a notice of transfer or notice of new service or letter from them and they have refused to provide me with one. 



Not only this issue, but on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by my XXXX that my NEW payment was increased by {$40.00}, due to a recent Escrow Analysis. Further investigation showed that the most recent escrow analysis was performed on XX/XX/2021 PRIOR to the latest approval for workout. NO analysis has been performed since then and, once again, Flagstar seems to be operating on deceptive business practices.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,5162002
Closing an account,"Hi, I am reaching out regarding the above account number. Chime Bank, has closed my account and refused to give a refund of the balance of the account. My SBA loan was deposited back on XX/XX/XXXX. On about XX/XX/XXXX they suspended the account without notice or an explanation why. After going back and forth for 2 weeks, they requested every single piece of my private data. I initially sent in my ID and SSN, but now have asked for more and its very concerning. I have not made not a single transaction. I never received any documents from them in the mail, not even a debit card. So there has not been any activity on the account. Then out of the blue, on XX/XX/XXXX, closed the account and told me Im not getting a refund. I hate I ever chose this institution to do business with and this is a total nightmare. They dont allow you to get anything resolved over the phone. The reps says just to email a support box and Ive now grown suspicious of their practices and dont feel comfortable sending anything additional. And after checking reviews online and social media, have noticed they have done this to numerous consumers unjustifiably. 

I called and emailed, emailed and called and no one seems to be ale to help me. All I get is scripted messages stating the same things over and over as opposed to someone directly addressing my concerns. 

Yet they only continue to give these same scripted responses. I need a real live person to communicate with. I only have ONE form of ID. There is no other government issued ID that any citizen is required to have. You all cant hold my funds simply because of this. 

I need to understand WHY the account was suspended. Exactly which part of the member agreement was violated? Please answer this question for me in your next response. There has not been one transaction made on this account. So what activity would justify suspending my account? 

I have submitted utility bill and ID as originally instructed. I have used the same documentation, along with tax returns to the US Government and has no issues, yet Chime has deemed it as unacceptable. I find that quite odd and outrageous to say the least. 

This is a very shady and deceptive business practice when a customer is trying to get an issue resolved. Were in the middle of a pandemic and to hold anyones funds without explanation is obsurd. I plan to take full legal action if you all can not get this resolved timely. 

Im still confused as to what activity or behavior would warrant closing my account. Again, I didnt make any transactions. I only had the SBA deposit. Was it closed because of this type of deposit or the amount?

Also, what do I need to do so I can secure the funds. I am responsible for paying this loan back and its indefensible to be on the hook for repayment of money that I never had available to use. I already reached out to the SBA and they told me I need to resolve it with you all or take legal action because there isnt a way for them to have the money returned. 

The above statement in quotes is what I have sent to Chime, as well as XXXX XXXX, whom is believed to be the card issuer and FDIC insured institution.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"Navient has taken auto debated from my account for two months after payoff of my Federal Direct student loans.

Checks for {$120000.00} sent to Navient XXXX Navient posted the received amount with resulting {$89.00} credit ( Date of zero balance ) All loans posted correctly. 
XXXX Navient initiated auto withdrawal of {$1900.00} from Savings Acc. ( Should have not been withdrawn ) After calling in, the rep. stated that the payment would be reversed and that the money should be going back to the savings acct. Agent of Navient suggested contacting bank.

Managing the loan or lease,"For starters American Credit Acceptance is saying that I don't have any payments made on the car loan for a XXXX  XXXX XXXX  from XXXX XXXX. But if you go to their website and put in the same email address and password that I used to register with you guys, you will see under their transaction history that some of the payments were not returned to my friends who thought I was getting a raw deal. Under their transaction history there are XXXX payments of XXXX which total to XXXX then they are XXXX payments of XXXX which total to XXXX with both of them together total to XXXX and when you subtract from the price of the car there remains an overpayment of XXXX. Since I made two payments with my chase account and my friends all used XXXX  XXXX XXXX they are saying that I didn't make any payments for the car which I did.

Problem when making payments,"I was astonished once I looked at my XXXX, XXXX and XXXX credit reports and realized that I was reported as having a late payment on the date below : 30 days past due X/2016 I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this occurred, I thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it was n't recorded on time.",,2655289
"Managing, opening, or closing account","Rushcard : I lost my card on XXXX I was told a replacement card would be sent but could take XXXX business days to receive. On XXXX XXXX marked the 10th business day and I had not receievd the replacement. I attempted to call and with all of the issues occuring due to the system glitch I have yet to get a hold of anyone that could help me with the replacement of my card. At this point XXXX deposits of XXXX each are sitting on the card with inability to use as they told me the card was blocked. I did later not sure how or why was able to use my card via XXXX ( saved on my account ), but because I can not remember the card # and or XXXX digits on the back I 'm only limited to purchases on XXXX. The transfer option is not available ( a friend also has XXXX and was willing to help by giving me the funds after transferring to her ). I was able to addmyself as a payee and submitted a partial payment as a test to see if the payment would come. BUT this was only 2 days ago, and the scheduled time for arrival is 5 business days. We shall see if this option works in any way. Needless to say with {$1000.00} sitting on a card I ca n't acess has put me in a tight spot as my other cards are used for paying bills and in doing so am left scrambling to purchase other things. The service has been nothing but disspppointing, with NO ONE I have spoken to having no access to view my account, so they say, because many others have had the ability to check. There has been no effort to provide me with any updates other than those found on their site and it 's even more dissappointing that they are lying about being back up and running. I expect there be much more offered by the company than waiving of fees for a few months. That 's absolutely ridiculous to think that will resolve any issues they have caused for the thousands affected.",,1622485
Payoff process,"Synchrony Bank did NOT adequately remind me that my promotional "" Zero Interest '' was nearing it 's completion. I set up and fully executed a {$300.00} am month automatic payment AND, here 's my mistake, EMAIL statements, trying to save a tree or XXXX. The combination of automatic payments, email 's whose only subject was "" Your statement is ready '' and human nature, I missed the end of the promotional period. I originally borrowed {$9000.00}, paid it down to {$3600.00} and then they added MORE THAN I OWED in interest : {$3700.00}. I paid two more auto payments before I noticed on the statement that I owed something like {$6800.00}, which was a whole lot more than my Quicken account had on it. Two calls to the company provided no relief. 

It is true that they are within the provisions of the agreement. They won the game. I lost, and yet I feel liked I got XXXX. When I reviewed my email statements, the ONLY place in which they gave me what I presume to be the legally required notice regarding the pending end of the promotional period, was on the statements which I had to open online and were NOT distinguished in anyway. Apparently, the law does not force them to make the "" end of promotional '' statement stand out. This company probably complied with the law but NOT any concern for making me aware of my pending XXXX. 
At the very least, I believe they should be legally obligated to announce the pending end of the promotional period IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. I believe the laws are inadequate in this regard. 

I have the money and will certainly pay it off and close the account, but I 'd sure like a response from someone about this before I do so. I also at least intend to call attorney 's I found online who stand ready to sue this company.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,1894570

Trouble using your card,"I applied and received a XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. There were no problems or difficulties initially. I requested and received a physical card. I made my first purchase with it on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX dollars. This worked without issue. I attempted to make a large purchase on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX. This was declined. I called in figuring they needed verification. The first woman I spoke to said my account was in review and they could not verify my information. I escalated to her "" Supervisor '' whom repeatedly misgendered me on the phone. When corrected, the "" supervisor '' stated and I quote, "" Ok Ma'am whatever you want to call yourself. '' That was call one. I then contacted XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed by apple support that they would get me in contact with Goldman Sachs to resolve the issue. The agent at Goldman Sachs stated that they can not resolve an issue via inbound call so they would arrange a call back. I never received a callback. Subsequent calls to find out a status have been met with a "" Don't Call us We will call you '' that never receives a call. On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to use the inline support through the XXXX App on the XXXX and received the same "" Don't call us we will call you. '' response. I will attach the chat log to this image.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I was mislead by PayPal Credit and forced to pay unnecessary interest. The paypal credit line of credit allows you to make purchases online using the paypal service and your line of credit which gives you a promotional period of 0 % APR for 6 months. If paid in full in 6 months there is no deferred interest, if not, the deferred interest is added to your account for the whole 6 months prior. The monthly statement, in bold letters includes a number that appears to be the amount to pay to avoid paying any interest, however it is really including promotional balances that have expired. this is very misleading, and caused me to miss the deadline to payoff some promotional balances. The misleading statement caused me to pay {$120.00} in deferred interest that I would have avoided if the statement had simply stated how much was due for promotional deferred interest and when it needed to be paid. 

Additionally, PayPal Credit has just out of the blue changed their terms for my line of credit. I don't really care about them making there be a minimum payment as much as changing the interest rate from an already high 19.9 % APR to now 25.9 % APR!!! That is absurd?! They raised the interest rate for no reason by 6 % APR.

Delinquent account,"I have some issues regarding my Amazon Store Card account, I was hoping that someone would help clear-up : In XX/XX/XXXX after using the same password when logging into my online account since I first opened my account, my password no longer worked. I called customer service about this so I could make a payment, they said they had my bank account info and would process a payment. I also asked for a replacement card at that time. Unbeknownst to me, my XX/XX/XXXX payment which I made online had not been credited! Then later in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter that said my account was delinquent, to my great surprise. Now both of my last XXXX payments made failed on their end and my account was n't credited! So I sent a personal check payment along but did n't have time to call because I was going to be out of town for awhile. 

On XXXX XXXX, I had time and called customer service again, my first XXXX attempts I was hung-up on after holding for very long times. After a hour of trying to speak to a rep, I was finally successful and got to speak with XXXX about the events that occurred. We spoke about how my payments were n't being credited, which she could n't give me a reason for. We also discussed how my passwords were n't working and how I was unable to access my online account, again she did n't know why. She helped me access my online account and told me I had n't been charged any online late fees and that I was in good standing. XXXX also said she would send me the replacement card I had n't received from my last request. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called customer service again because my new password was n't working again and I was unable to access my account. I again had to request a replacement card because I still had n't receive one since the last XXXX requests. Once online I now could n't view all of my previous statements, even though I was always able to in the past. 

Of greatest concern is that in XX/XX/XXXX, I received a copy of my credit report and saw that Synchrony Bank reported me as delinquent past XXXX days in XX/XX/XXXX. This is unfair considering my attempts to make payments and access my online account failed due to problems at Synchrony Bank. I ask that Synchrony Bank fix this and remove this blemish off of my credit report immediately. 

Overall the experience recently with SB bank has been very disappointing, frustrating, and time consuming. I never had problems with this account before Synchrony Bank took over my account from GE. I look forward to hearing from someone from Synchrony Bank regarding the negative mark left on my credit report.",,1454194
Struggling to pay mortgage,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX apt XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2023 ServiSolutions Mortgage Company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AL XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX and XXXX Subject : Request for Removal of Late Payments During COVID-19 Hardship Dear Customer Service Team, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for your assistance throughout my mortgage journey with ServiSolutions. I am writing with the hope that you will consider my request to remove late payments from my account that occurred during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, when I faced temporary financial hardship due to being laid off. 
First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the exceptional service I have received from your company during my loan tenure. The professionalism and understanding exhibited by your team have been deeply appreciated, and I am grateful for the support I received during the difficult period of financial instability. 
Unfortunately, like millions of other individuals around the world, I experienced significant financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of being laid off from my job, I faced considerable hardships in meeting my financial obligations, including my mortgage payments. Despite my best efforts to keep up with my payments, I regrettably incurred late payments on my mortgage account. 
I want to emphasize that I am a dedicated and responsible borrower who has always prioritized fulfilling my obligations. The financial struggles during this pandemic were unforeseen and beyond my control, leaving me with limited options at the time. 
The purpose of this letter is to request your kind consideration in removing the late payment remarks associated with my account. As of today, I am thrilled to inform you that I have successfully paid off both of my loan accounts tied to Account Number : XXXX. I am immensely proud of this achievement, and it would mean a great deal to me if the late payments tied to this account could be compassionately removed from my credit history. 
Removing these late payments would greatly improve my credit score and financial standing, allowing me to move forward with confidence and stability. I firmly believe that this one-time hardship should not define my creditworthiness or my relationship with ServiSolutions. 
I understand that your company adheres to strict policies and guidelines. Nevertheless, I kindly request that you review my account history in light of the unprecedented circumstances that unfolded during the XXXX pandemic. I sincerely hope you can see the efforts I made to overcome these hardships and fulfill my obligations to the best of my ability. 
I am committed to maintaining a positive payment record in the future, and I assure you that my current financial situation is stable and will enable me to meet all my financial commitments promptly. 
In conclusion, I would like to extend my appreciation for considering my request. I am sincerely grateful for the support and understanding I have received from your company thus far. Your consideration in removing the late payments would make a significant difference in my life and future financial endeavors. 
Please feel free to reach out to me at [ your phone number ] or [ your email address ] should you require any additional information or documentation. I look forward to a positive resolution to this matter. 
Thank you once again for your time and attention.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","I obtained a mortgage from Homestar Financial Corp. for {$60000.00} at 3.5 % interest rate. The loan number was XXXX. I made my first payment of {$31000.00} to pay off part of the mortgage on XXXX/XXXX/2016 to Homestar. 

They cashed the check on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and applied only {$660.00} toward the mortgage and then sold the mortgage to XXXX ( account number XXXX ). The balance transferred to XXXX was {$59000.00}. This balance clearly failed to reduce the amount by the additional {$30000.00} they had cashed on XXXX/XXXX/2016. 

After I received the XXXX statement in XXXX and saw that clearly that the bulk of the XXXX payment had not been applied to the mortgage balance transferred to XXXX. I called Homestar and they always transferred me to "" XXXX ''. 

XXXX never answered her phone and XXXX or XXXX messages went unanswered. Finally, I told the operator at Homestar that I needed to speak with someone other than XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and she was helpful in getting us answers even though it was not her Dept. Shortly afterwards we received a called from XXXX at Homestar who did n't know what happened.

Can't repay my loan,"I have a private student loan through Navient ( formerly XXXX XXXX ). I feel this loan was made with predatory intentions. As I entered my final year of undergraduate education at Louisiana XXXX University in XXXX XXXX, I was told there would not be enough funding available and my only option would be a private student loan. ( Had I known how this loan would work I would have used another lender. ) I was referred to XXXX XXXX as it was the largest lender for these types of loans. 

After graduation I decided to continue my education and pursue a XXXX. After being accepted into the program it was another four years until I graduated with a XXXX ( XXXX ). The entire time interest accrued on that original loan at 9.5 %, which I feel is an unfairly high rate considering I had relatively good credit while working part time during college. Again, I needed money to finish school and should have looked for better options. So, now fast forward a year. What I did not realize was that I was only able to receive one year of forbearance on this loan. After graduation I made a series of business loans to start XXXX. My business has grown steadily over the last two years but income is irregular in that I am at the mercy of insurance companies for reimbursement. On some months income wanes and I do not make enough to cover all of my expenses. I called Navient to discuss a short one month forbearance so my credit would not be affected and was told I was no longer eligible and should just skip the payment. I did that and then later was able to catch up. Now we have a a bit of a slow period and I have not been able to make a payment for 4 months. I have spoken with Navient several times and usually were not willing to take anything less than the total amount past due. I spoke with them today and they offered a reduced payment for 15 months but I would need to pay them XXXX dollars by Friday. I do not have an extra XXXX dollars at this time. I was told I would be receiving a letter from their attorney. The person I spoke with liked to raise her voice quit often when I explained that my business and living expenses come first and then if anything is left I could pay the amount they requested. I am very frustrated with this company and have had very rude calls to my home line and my business line. I feel that this loan was originally made in a predatory fashion and I was taken advantage of as countless others have also been victims of this company. My original loan was for XXXX dollars. Now the debt is over XXXX. I have explained to them many times that I intend to pay the debt but they are no longer willing to work with me. Today they threatened me with wage garnishment. My response is that I would then be forced to apply for bankruptcy and attempt to have this debt either discharged in chapter XXXX or reduced in chapter XXXX. I do not want to do that but they may force my hand.",,1628642
Fees or interest,"I have been a credit card holder of Discover for many years. My payment due date is on the eighth of every month. I did not have any issues with Discover until the year XXXX. 
My first problem with Discover started in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made my minimum monthly payment of {$66.00} after the cut off time at XXXX but on that same day. I realized that a late fee was assessed on my account, which I called and got it waived. I also realized that the next months minimum payment ( XXXX ) had increased to over {$100.00}. I believed the bank arrived at this new minimum payment due in XXXX based on the late payment that occurred in XXXX. Unfortunately, for me I lost my job in XXXX, so I called and told them that because of my situation I can not afford to pay the new minimum amount due. I told them I was prepared and can afford to pay the minimum amount of {$66.00} that I had paid the previous months ( assuming no more purchases for the month ). The person that I talked to said she would discuss with her supervisor and get back to me. I did not hear from Discover, either by phone or mail, therefore I made a payment of {$66.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and continued to make payments of {$66.00} every month until XX/XX/XXXX. 
Discover reported me to credit bureau that I made insufficient payments on my account. I never missed any payment and never used the card since XX/XX/XXXX. Discover Credit Card considered the {$66.00} monthly payment insufficient. I got 100 points reduction on my credit score. I called Discover to find out what could be done. The person I talked to suggested that I sign up for a hardship program for one year, which will give a low interest rate of 9 % and a reduced minimum monthly payment of {$49.00}. I agreed and signed up and later realized that another 100 points had reduced my credit score. I had no other option so I decided not to use that card again and have still not used it up to today.. The hardship program ended in XX/XX/XXXX and l began paying {$66.00} as monthly minimum payment required by Discover.

The second problem with Discover, which is the reason of my complaint, started in XX/XX/XXXX. One of the conditions of the hardship program was to set up automatic monthly payment, which I did using my XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) bank checking account ending XXXX. Then in XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new XXXX checking account and decided to stop using the banking account ending in XXXX for my Discover Credit Card payment. I therefore set up a new payment of {$66.00} using the new checking account ending in for the required minimum monthly payment in XXXX. What happened was that the payment of {$66.00} that I set up went through and Discover dot paid. I later found out that Discover again managed and took another {$66.00} out of the new checking account although that new checking account was not the one been used for the automatic payment. I ended up making two payments in XXXX ( refer to exhibit 1 ). 
I immediately called Discover and informed them what had happened. I was told initially the refund would be credited to my checking account. After waiting for some days without seeing the refund, I called again and was told the refund will be in a form of a check from Discover. On the XX/XX/XXXX, a day to my XXXX payment due date I had not received the check so I called again and told them that they have my money with them for almost one month and I have not received the check, they should use the money with them for my XXXX monthly minimum payment. I again said they can either cancel the check or I return the check when I receive it. I called again the following day, which was my payment due date and was told they will get back to me. No one got back to me so I did not make any more payment in XXXX. I received the check in XX/XX/XXXX but did not cash it because I had already told Discover to use if for XXXX payment ( refer to exhibit 2 ). As states earlier, I did not make any payment in XXXX and Discover considered it as a missed payment. Since XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I have been paying {$66.00} every month, never missed a payment. I have not missed a payment, and never used the card since XX/XX/XXXX so I believe my minimum monthly payment should not be more than {$66.00}. 
Somewhere in XX/XX/XXXX, I got a call from Discover and the man I talked to told me that if I make a payment of {$120.00}, he would clear or remove all the late payment fees on the account. I decided to cash the check I received from Discover and made two payments ( {$130.00} ) in XXXX, but to my surprise, the late payment fee on my account was not removed. 
I have been denied online access to my account. I can not make my monthly payment of {$66.00} online. I always have to call to make a payment. 
As at the time of writing this letter the outstanding balance on the account is more than the same period two years ago even though I have not used the card since XX/XX/XXXX and also been paying {$66.00} every month. What Discover want me to pay as the minimum payment due is basically the late payment fees and insufficient payment fees that have been wrongfully charged to my account.",,2947000

Struggling to pay mortgage,"Hello- I do hope you can help me with LoanCare. I have been trying to work out a disaster repayment plan with LoanCare. I was on a forbearance program due to Hurricane Ian from XXXX to XXXX, XXXX. I was incredibly grateful LoanCare offered such a program. I entered the program under the pretense at the end of the forbearance period, someone would work with me on a repayment plan, to pay what I could and my good credit standing would not be impacted. I made a payment in XXXX of {$510.00} and a full payment in XXXX, {$1500.00}. My good credit standing is extremely important for my Government clearance. I started calling LoanCare around XXXX to discuss a disaster repayment plan. I was told someone would contact me at the end of the forbearance period. I received and completed the Mortgage Assistance Application and submitted it on XX/XX/XXXX as I was advised by a LoanCare representative around XXXX XXXX when I called to wait until the end of the forbearance period. I received no response so I followed-up with a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. I attempted to makes another payment which was declined by LoanCare unless I could pay {$2400.00}, stating I was more than 60 days late and they could only accept a full payment or submit additional documentation for underwriting. I provided the requested documents on XX/XX/XXXX. Again I was assured there would be no impact to my credit score while a plan was being worked out with underwriting. XX/XX/XXXX, I learned LoanCare reported me as being 60 days late to the credit bureau. I spoke with another LoanCare representative on XX/XX/XXXX who stated I was told misinformation on XX/XX/XXXX, that LoanCare did not have me under the disaster forbearance program, she contacted her supervisor to correct the credit reporting and she stated NO additional documents were required from me and my current interest rate would not be changed. The next step was for underwriting to work out a disaster repayment plan. I called on XX/XX/XXXX as I had not heard back from underwriting. The LoanCare representative stated, I received incorrect information on XX/XX/XXXX. Additional documents were needed, my interest rate would like increase to the current rate and the credit bureau would continue to be notified of late payments. The only way I could prevent this was to pay {$3800.00}. I explained I receive drastically different or misinformation every time I contact LoanCare. If I knew of this impact, I would not have entered into the disaster forbearance program. I explained that every time I contact LoanCare I am misinformed and requested to speak with a manager to no avail. I followed up with an email to LoanCares Mitigation Department in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX requesting for management to contact me so we can work out a disaster repayment plan there has been no response.

Getting a credit card,"American Express obtained a finance charge in this purchase money loan whereas a purchase money loan is defined in 16 CFR 433.1 ( d ) as a cash advance which is received by a consumer in return for a Finance Charge. American Express utilized the consumers credit card as defined in 15 USC 1602 ( l ) defines the term credit card as any card, plate, coupon book or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or services on credit. To obtain a finance charge. 
The consumer was denied the cash advance and/or credit extension, based on the color of a credit reporting agencies illegal information reporting on consumer transactions defined in 15 U.S. Code 1681a Exclusions, which states that a consumer report should not include any information solely pertaining to transactions or experiences between the Claimant/Consumer and the person making the report. 
On XX/XX/2023, the consumer contacted American Express to request the legal basis for their decision to deny the consumer the right to extend credit in accordance with 15 U.S. Code 1602 - ( f ), which defines credit as "" the right granted by a creditor to a debtor to defer payment of debt or to incur debt and defer its payment. '' The consumer was not provided with any legal basis for the decision and was denied access to speak to the underwriter who had securitized the consumer 's application. 
American Express in violation of 15 USC 1611 Wherein as Misleading and false information in conjunction with a credit transaction was relayed to consumer justifying a denial of an extension of credit wherein as out of the same transaction American Express received a benefit. 
American Express is in violation of 15 U.S.C. 1691 ( a ) ( 3 ) which explicitly prohibits discrimination against any consumer for exercising his or her right to obtain credit. American Express has been found to be in violation of the Securities Exchange Act, as they have securitized the consumer 's application and selling it on the open market for profit, for their unjust enrichment, at the detriment to the consumer. This constitutes securities fraud. American Express failed to disclose pertinent information to the consumer which would have enabled the consumer to make an intelligent decision. 

The consumer was misled by American Express ' deceptive practices, and believes that these practices amount to identity theft, securities fraud, tax evasion, and various other federal violations. Furthermore, American Express unlawfully utilized the US mail to deliver deceptive forms to consumers with the intention to deny them an extension of their own credit, an act that is illegal for American Express as it does not have the legal authority to lend its own money or credit. This has caused consumers to have a lack of trust in the banking system. 

American Express is aware that the consumer is crediting the transaction, whereas American Express, through deceptive means, is obtaining the consumer 's social security numbers ( credit card ) and other identifying information, in order to fraudulently access the consumer 's open-ended credit plan, misappropriate the funds, and unjustly enrich themselves through securities fraud.",,6906910

Closing your account,"I have been a Chase customer for over 13 years and currently have 4 different credit cards with Chase. I spend ~50 % of my time traveling for work and use multiple credit cards to separate my expenses along with maximizing my rewards depending on which airline I fly and hotel I stay with. I spend well over 100k a year across all my cards. My credit score is above 750 with 13 years of history. I have never missed a payment, have fully paid off 2 car loans and all my student loans ( including ones financed by Chase ).

On a monthly basis I receive promotional offers in the mail from Chase saying I've been pre-approved for this credit card or this balance transfer fee. At the end of XXXX I decided to apply for the pre approved offers for two credit cards chase sent me in the mail. I also took advantage of a Chase balance transfer offer they sent me in the mail. About a week later all my accounts were closed with Chase with no reason or warning. It took them 7 days from the closure to notify me in the mail. Because they waited 7 days to let me know my cards were closed many of my auto payments I had setup failed and I was charged late fees for my utility bills, cell phone, internet, etc. 

I contacted Chase to see what happened and they couldn't provide me with any concrete answers. They said I am a high risk customer and they can't have a relationship with me. I asked if they couldn't have a relationship with me why would they send me pre-approved credit card offers on a monthly basis? This is misleading and aggressive tactics. The reps response was rude and didn't want to hear anything from me. The rep also said that the decision is final and they can't do anything about it. I mentioned that I had researched online and this looks like a common issue with Chase and many people were able to get their accounts re-instated. This only made the rep more upset and they started to yell at me. This is XXXX XXXX behavior coming from a large bank! 

I contacted another rep at Chase who immediately put in a request to re-open the accounts. Why different reps say different things shows lack of consistency across Chase. A week later I got a phone call stating they couldn't reverse the decision and my accounts were remained closed. 

I believe Chase is taking advantage of consumers and has engaged in misleading and aggressive tactics. Here 's examples of the predatory, anti-consumer tactics used by Chase 1 ) Chase sends me multiple credit card offers a month saying I'm pre approved. But then after I apply they close all my accounts. If you think I'm a risky customer then dont aggressively ask me to open more cards under your bank. This is predatory behavior!

2 ) Chase needs to be more consistent on what defines a closure. All the reps were clearly untrained about this policy. Some people can get their accounts back while others cant and there's no clear rule that decides if an account can be reopened or not. If you challenge the reps they become extremely rude to you, start yelling, and verbally attacking you. It's like common, all my credit cards were closed and this is a huge hassle for me. Chase should be better prepared to handle these situations. 

3 ) Even after my shutdown I'm still getting pre-approved credit card offers and balance transfer checks? Seriously Chase? If this isn't predatory behavior I dont know what is. You shut me down and you still aggressively target me for credit card offers?

4 ) Chase has 0 value in customer loyalty. Chase has been my primary bank since I was XXXX years old. Many of my credit cards with them are over 10 years old. I explained to them since I spend 50 % of my time traveling I need a large amount of cards to  separate all my expenses. They just laugh and say sorry we don't want a relationship with you. Ironically they left my checking account still open.",,2848846

As an adult student, I took my education very seriously graduating with a XXXX GPA. I am very proud of myself for this accomplishment because with online classes it is up to the student to succeed ; meaning the student basically self teaches and the teacher simply provides grades for assignments they post.

However, I have come to realize that my degree was a $ XXXX  scam and attending XXXX  was the ringleader in this scam.

After discovering that {$1600.00} in checks were missing on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX different claim forms provided by AmEx were submitted : first on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ; then on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ; and repeatedly through XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, a third set of forms ( Travelers Cheque Refund Reimbursement Agreement and Terms & Conditions-Purchase Agreement ) sent by AmEx was returned ( by certified mail, email and fax ). There have been numerous emails, faxes, and letters, and conversations with XXXX AmEx and XXXX Bank agents. See Attachment 1 Chronology ( summary of contacts ) and Attachments XXXX-XXXX ( copies of all correspondence ). 

I was advised the checks had not been and likely could not be cashed as they are on high alert. AmEx supervisor XXXX ( office in XXXX ) stated in conversation memorialized in my cover letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that my claims were satisfactory and would be paid within XXXX business days after AmEx received the third set of forms. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX AmEx received those forms, modified as discussed with XXXX ; but they still have not reimbursed me. 

Instead, they engaged in a deliberate continuing, repetitive pattern of unfair, deceptive, abusive and discriminatory practices, which seemed designed to delay and defraud. Bank agents reported that many customers had similar problems with AmEx. And, my experience is similar to complaints on the internet of many buyers of AmEx services ( such as Travelers Checks, Bluebird, Serve, XXXX, XXXX or XXXX ), all seemingly supervised by the same agents/offices. See, eg. : internet reports in Attachment XXXX. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX 's subordinate, XXXX, telephoned to discuss the Reimbursement Agreement and Purchase Agreement. I had difficulty understanding his accent and asked him to send an email/letter specifying any problems, and precise directions for remedy. No response was received. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I asked Bank to reimburse me, as promised in XX/XX/XXXX. I provided copies of the attached documents. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I spoke with Bank Officer XXXX XXXX, who reported AmEx agent XXXX told her the problem was that the agreed-upon cross-out deletions on the forms were made with black ink pen and yellow highlighter ( as XXXX suggested ) but, without stated reasons, AmEx did not want the black ink. 

This difference, without substantive distinction, raised integrity issues re AmEx not confirming the intended deletions of : acknowledgment of failure to comply ; agreement AmEx could not stop payment on checks ; release of AmEx from all actions, liabilities, contracts ; waiver of the right to challenge authenticated signatures ; payment of all AmEx costs, expenses and attorneys fees ; waiver of the right to jury trial ; agreement to jurisdiction and venue in XXXX XXXX County, Utah ; and waiver of any claims of lack of jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. The deletions also removed a purchase agreement sought by AmEx almost 20 years after purchase, reciting numerous matters not originally agreed to, seeming to be extortion by supposed fiduciaries to force a new contract of adhesion. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX ' superior XXXX XXXX, who said that Bank would find someone higher at AmEx in the United States, not XXXX, nor overseas, and "" escalate. '' On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX phoned to say she had contacted XXXX XXXX at AmEx who would speak to me ; but XXXX did not take my return call. His assistant XXXX said she and XXXX worked in the XXXX, and were subordinate to XXXX in XXXX. Thus there was no escalation ; it all ended up full-circle, back again on the treadmill with XXXX. My telephone messages to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX were unanswered. I have not been reimbursed.",,1541113

"Managing, opening, or closing account","I had a "" Thanks for Sharing '' card from Macy 's with {$94.00} on it that Macy 's is unable to release funds for. The card was received in XXXX and does not have an expiration. I was charged {$25.00} to enroll in this rewards program, and the funds were earned as 10 % of purchases made in XXXX on my Macy 's card. While they can see the funds on the card and say it has n't expired, there is a block on the card as they need to activate it via the card that accrued the points, however they are unable to find my Macy 's card in their system as its been inactive too long. After several attempts with them unable to pull up my Macy 's card info, they 've told me they 've gone ahead and removed the block and I can go into Macy 's to redeem it, only to have it rejected during checkout and finding out a block is still in place. We 've been in Macy 's 4 times in attempts to use this card, each time being told its been unlocked and ready to use only to be unable to use it. My mother who I was giving the card to does not drive and lives 30 minutes from Macy 's, so this is a hardship for her to get transportation there only to be unable to redeem it. It 's been about 6 months of attempting to use this card, with no resolution on Macy 's end. I was first told the block was removed in XXXX by a card activation associate "" XXXX '', but my mother was still unable to use it later that month. On XX/XX/XXXX I was in Florida with my mother with both cards in-hand ( I had the original Macy 's Card, she had the Thanks for Sharing card we are attempting to redeem ), so I called back in to get this straightened out. I was told by "" XXXX '' that she sees the block was removed XXXX, but put back by someone on their end on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me she 's removed the block again, entering in account notes not to reactivate the block, and that we can now redeem it. Within a few hours, we went to Macy 's however upon checking out, the card would n't go through with a notation for the sales associate to call the card department. Upon speaking with someone from their loyalty department ( XX/XX/XXXX approx XXXX ) I was told that she is unable to release the funds on the Thanks for Sharing card without an active card, however she attempted to get me to open a new credit card account saying that this would resolve the issue. Skeptical of this as I was previously told it was a security feature that the original card that accrued the points was needed to active the Sharing card, both myself and XXXX, a sales Manager at the XXXX Fl location questioned this, only to be told that this might not work. ( Note, I believe offering a false promise of compensation/consideration for opening a line of credit is against UDAAP guidelines ). At this point I was put in touch with her supervisor XXXX ( employee XXXX ), who informed me that she did not know how to remove the block, but would make inquiries on their end and get back to me within 3 days. On XX/XX/XXXX without hearing back, I 've called Macy 's and been put in touch with XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who says he is unable to see any holds on their end stopping me from using the Sharing card, it must be user error at the store and I can go in and use it. Going back to Macy 's on XX/XX/XXXX, they are still unable to use the card, but a store manager said she 's seen this issue several times with the Thanks for Sharing card, and exchanged the card for "" Macy 's Money '' coupons telling me I should be able to use that. Note : I typically do not shop Macy 's as I find them to be more expensive than other stores, but made additional purchases in XXXX with the understanding that I was earning money back on my Thanks for Sharing card.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","This is an issue my mom and I are having with Ocwen Loan Servicing. The mortgage is in my mom 's name, but I sometimes made payments from my bank account. In XXXX 2016, Ocwen Loan Servicing reported to XXXX that they did n't receive payments for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Our loan was transferred from Ocwen to XXXX in XXXX. XXXX paid Ocwen, which made the account 3 months behind. A week after this, we were notified and advised XXXX that the info Ocwen provided was incorrect. We supplied bank statements, a letter from the bank, a detailed/revolving bank statement, and ACH Transaction statements. Our bank has said that this is all the information they have. Every time we provide Ocwen with the documents they request, they come back and ask for more. First they asked for bank statements for 3 months of the payments - we provided. Then they asked for bank statements until the current time to show the payments were n't reversed - we provided. They asked for a letter from the bank - we provided. They asked for the ACH detail - we provided. They asked for a revolving bank statement - we provided. We have been told by Ocwen several times that "" this is the last document they need '' and that they expect to have a resolution soon. Every time I have to contact the bank, they say they have never heard of anything like this. This has been going on for 3 months now. We have provided everything they have asked for but they keep saying they are investigating it. It 's not our fault Ocwen ca n't find the payments. I made other payments to Ocwen through their website/payment system with no issue. It 's not our fault they ca n't find the payments and we should n't be punished by having the mortgage showing 3 months behind. We have asked that the money be given back to XXXX to make the account current. Twice our bank has suggested that we submit a complaint with CFPB. We were hoping to wait until we got the funds back, but since it does n't seem like that is going to happen any time soon, we decided that now we should submit a complaint. We made the payments and do n't feel that it 's fair, or legal, that Ocwen was able to go to XXXX XXXX9 months after the payments were made and claim they did n't receive them! We are getting calls and letters from XXXX almost daily because of this. Before this happened, we had set up a mortgage accelerator to try and get it paid off faster! Because of this mess up on Ocwen 's end, my mom has had to take out money from my dad 's life insurance policy. I wish he had taken out enough to cover the full cost of the mortgage, but unfortunately we do n't have enough to pay it off completely. I feel like we are just jumping through hoop after hoop for Ocwen and they are just playing games. {$2000.00} might not a lot to them, but it is a lot of money for us! There are also late fees on the current mortgage because of this. An Ocwen representative told my mom this has happened before and Ocwen or Ocwen 's bank had directed the money to an incorrect account. After speaking with a representative from our bank today, I feel like this is really our only option. I really do n't understand how it is legal to say payments were n't received over 6 months later and when the account is showing current on their website! I also do n't understand how keep playing these games! We have provided more than enough information! It 's not our fault that they ca n't find it on their end! Please help us!",,2060969

In the case of a billing error where the obligor alleges that the creditors billing statement reflects goods not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of the transaction, a creditor may not construe such amount to be correctly shown unless he determines that such goods were actually delivered, mailed, or otherwise sent to the obligor and provides the obligor with a statement of such determination. 
After complying with the provisions of this subsection with respect to an alleged billing error, a creditor has no further responsibility under this section if the obligor continues to make substantially the same allegation with respect to such error. 
( b ) Billing error For the purpose of this section, a billing error consists of any of the following : ( 1 ) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit which was not made to the obligor or, if made, was not in the amount reflected on such statement.

( 2 ) A reflection on a statement of an extension of credit for which the obligor requests additional clarification including documentary evidence thereof.

( 3 ) A reflection on a statement of goods or services not accepted by the obligor or his designee or not delivered to the obligor or his designee in accordance with the agreement made at the time of a transaction.

( 4 ) The creditors failure to reflect properly on a statement a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor.

( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement.

( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required.

( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau.

( c ) Action by creditor to collect amount or any part thereof regarded by obligor to be a billing error For the purposes of this section, action to collect the amount, or any part thereof, indicated by an obligor under paragraph ( 2 ) does not include the sending of statements of account, which may include finance charges on amounts in dispute, to the obligor following written notice from the obligor as specified under subsection ( a ), if ( 1 ) the obligors account is not restricted or closed because of the failure of the obligor to pay the amount indicated under paragraph ( 2 ) of subsection ( a ), and ( 2 ) the creditor indicates the payment of such amount is not required pending the creditors compliance with this section.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any action by a creditor to collect any amount which has not been indicated by the obligor to contain a billing error.

( d ) Restricting or closing by creditor of account regarded by obligor to contain a billing error Pursuant to regulations of the Bureau, a creditor operating an open end consumer credit plan may not, prior to the sending of the written explanation or clarification required under paragraph ( B ) ( ii ), restrict or close an account with respect to which the obligor has indicated pursuant to subsection ( a ) that he believes such account to contain a billing error solely because of the obligors failure to pay the amount indicated to be in error. Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prohibit a creditor from applying against the credit limit on the obligors account the amount indicated to be in error. 

( e ) Effect of noncompliance with requirements by creditor Any creditor who fails to comply with the requirements of this section or section 1666a of this title forfeits any right to collect from the obligor the amount indicated by the obligor under paragraph ( 2 ) of subsection ( a ) of this section, and any finance charges thereon, except that the amount required to be forfeited under this subsection may not exceed {$50.00}. 
Now the problem at hand is since I did not get notification of the investigation ( which I have stated numerous times ) until yesterday XX/XX/XXXX my account was in billing error status, THEREFORE you can not start collecting until today! 15 U.S. Code 1666b & 15 U.S. Code 1666c 15 U.S. Code 1666b-Timing of payments : ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

( b ) Grace period If an open end consumer credit plan provides a time period within which an obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended without incurring an additional finance charge, such additional finance charge may not be imposed with respect to such portion of the credit extended for the billing cycle of which such period is a part, unless a statement which includes the amount upon which the finance charge for the period is based was mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the date specified in the statement by which payment must be made in order to avoid imposition of that finance charge. 
15 U.S. Code 1666c - Prompt and fair crediting of payments : ( a ) In general Payments received from an obligor under an open end consumer credit plan by the creditor shall be posted promptly to the obligors account as specified in regulations of the Bureau. Such regulations shall prevent a finance charge from being imposed on any obligor if the creditor has received the obligors payment in readily identifiable form, by XXXX p.m. on the date on which such payment is due, in the amount, manner, and location indicated by the creditor to avoid the imposition thereof. 

( b ) Application of payments ( 1 ) In general Upon receipt of a payment from a cardholder, the card issuer shall apply amounts in excess of the minimum payment amount first to the card balance bearing the highest rate of interest, and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest, until the payment is exhausted.

( 2 ) Clarification relating to certain deferred interest arrangements A creditor shall allocate the entire amount paid by the consumer in excess of the minimum payment amount to a balance on which interest is deferred during the last 2 billing cycles immediately preceding the expiration of the period during which interest is deferred.

( c ) Changes by card issuer If a card issuer makes a material change in the mailing address, office, or procedures for handling cardholder payments, and such change causes a material delay in the crediting of a cardholder payment made during the 60-day period following the date on which such change took effect, the card issuer may not impose any late fee or finance charge for a late payment on the credit card account to which such payment was credited.

So now that I am bringing the billing error to your attention I am again putting this account in billing error status.15 U.S. Code 1666 - Correction of billing errors Per 1026.13 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( c ) Billing error resolution : 2. Correction without investigation. A creditor may correct a billing error in the manner and amount asserted by the consumer without the investigation or the determination normally required. The creditor must comply, however, with all other applicable provisions. If a creditor follows this procedure, no presumption is created that a billing error occurred. 3. Relationship with 1026.12. The consumer 's rights under the billing error provisions in 1026.13 are independent of the provisions set forth in 1026.12 ( b ) and ( c ). ( See comments 12 ( b ) -4, 12 ( b ) ( 3 ) -3, and 12 ( c ) -1. ) ( 1 ) The creditor shall mail or deliver written acknowledgment to the consumer within 30 days of receiving a billing error notice, unless the creditor has complied with the appropriate resolution procedures of paragraphs ( e ) and ( f ) of this section, as applicable, within the 30-day period; and ( 2 ) The creditor shall comply with the appropriate resolution procedures of paragraphs ( e ) and ( f ) of this section, as applicable, within 2 complete billing cycles ( but in no event later than 90 days ) after receiving a billing error notice. I have not received anything yet, and they have reported adverse action on my credit report.

15 U.S. Code 1666a-Regulation of credit reports- ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligors failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligors credit rating or credit standing because of the obligors failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts.

( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. 

( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported.

Getting a credit card,"I tried to get an Apple Card online -- I experienced nothing but frustration, and this has been 4 days of trying. The issuer is Goldman Sachs and the Sponsor is XXXX. The system is designed poorly, and the customer service is much, much worse -- I know because I have been a consumer protection lawyer for decades and have owned and run payment processing companies. 

I encountered a problem because my credit freeze was not lifted the first time applied. So I lifted the freeze and XXXX  did not implement timely. So a second fail occurred. I waited a couple of days and was assured that the freeze was lifted. I applied a third time, now that the freeze was lifted, but the processor denied my application for too many tries. 

I called customer service -- an agency working for Goldman and XXXX. They said their policy was strict -- I would have to wait 30 days and reapply. I asked why? No answer -- just "" policy ''. I asked to speak to representative of the issuer ( Goldman Sachs ) -- they discouraged this but I insisted. It took 76 minutes to connect with Goldman Sachs! Same response our policy is a 30 day wait. I made the observation that they were not providing a "" service '' to high credit XXXX individuals like me that were denied because of their system difficulties. There are other way to authenticate other than try two times and they are done for 30 days. They are not staffing customer support, they are giving lame excuses for a 30 day delay -- the industry standard is one day -- and they have cost me time and money. I was looking to buy XXXX products to make advantage of the discount, but my efforts have been frustrated and delayed by their system architecture, bad and non-sensical policies, and terrible staffing of customer service at the issuer. 

I was told after speaking to XXXX at Goldman Sachs that a supervisor would call me. No one followed up. 

I was told that I needed to use XXXX  if I wanted to lift my credit freeze. That is not my understanding as all three credit bureaus are to work in unison and XXXX or Goldman imposing their choice of a credit bureau on me is overstepping. Nonetheless I tried to enroll in XXXX  -- predictably they wanted a monthly fee. Their customer service said that once I was denied they would have to delete my profile and start again. It was adding insult to injury. 

Goldman is new to card issuing -- they have no business performing this service for XXXX if they cant design a consumer facing platform that applies a consumer friendly design. What sense does it make to freeze the application of a consumer that has good credit for 30 days? 

The bureau should have them justify their poor customer service staffing, and their nonsensical policies.",,3655370

Can't repay my loan,I have been harassed by Navient formerly XXXX XXXX on a recently defaulted loan. I am being called on my cell phone and at my work place after advising an account representative to only use my cell phone number provider. I first contacted Navient on XXXX XXXX to provide them with information regarding repayment. The representative advised my account manager was on lunch and that I should try withdrawing funds from a XXXX or borrowing the money from relatives. I found this to be very strange since she could not actually assist with my account. I advised her I was at work and would call back on Monday XXXX XXXX since the office was only open until XXXX that day. I also advised her and verified my cell phone number was the only number I was to be contacted on since I can not take personal calls at work and never gave out my work phone number. She said she noted the account and I would only be contacted at the number I provided. 30 Minutes later I received another call on my cell phone from my account manager asking to call him back and that my work place was contacted. Once again I already told the rep I spoke with I was at work and would not be off until XXXX when their office closed. On Monday XXXX XXXX I received a phone call to my cell phone and another call to my work place advising to call back and that Navient was returning a voice mail I placed. I never placed a voicemail and had specifically told the rep my cell phone number was the only number to call and I would be calling in after work. I immediately called back to speak to my account manager. I started by asking did he see the note to not call my employer work number since I can not receive personal calls there. He went on to say he saw no note and that he could not get a hold of me so he went to that method. I advised that I never gave Navient that phone number and my company has many different departments and numbers and to not use that number. He then stated since I was hiding so he had no choice and this is how he got me to call back. I advised I was not hiding but at work and preferred for Navient to not use an employer number I never provided. I then asked to speak to someone else revolving my account because I did not like the aggressive tone the account manager was using. He made no efforts to rectify the situation and persisted on threatening to send paperwork to my employer to garnish wages in 5 days. I never spoken to anyone regarding my options before this would take place even if it was possible so felt he was not being truthful. Reluctantly I was transferred to another gentleman who was not much help either. I asked him if he could go back and listen to the call with the account manager because I felt the information I got was incorrect. He too disregarded that question and advised I needed to settle this immediately. I advised I had not reviewed my options with anyone so I did n't know the options and why I was speaking to him. He went on to give me the options which I said was not feasible currently. He then told me I did n't even try and was unwilling to make an effort and that I should withdraw from my XXXX information I gave my account manager. I advised I never gave my account manager any XXXX information but only spoke with a rep who advised if I had one that would be a option. He then persisted on telling me I need to borrow money from family or friends and I 'd be suprised on how many people may help. I advised I could not come up with that money and needed another option. He then replied I 'm not making any money off this account and could care less what I did. The conversation ended with no resolution. I 'm asking for help because I know myself or my family can not come up with that amount of money and would like to be put on a reasonable plan.,,1432575

Fraud or scam,"On XX/XX/2021, I received {$50.00} via PayPal from one XXXX XXXX. XXXX  notified me that "" money was waiting '' via email so I knew the transfer was complete. I did nothing with the money until, on XX/XX/2021, I made an XXXX purchase in the amount of {$22.00}. I paid with PayPal, expecting that the {$50.00} that was on deposit would be decremented by the amount of the purchase. I checked my PayPal summary page only to discover that such was not the case. The {$50.00} was still there and still "" waiting ''. I called PayPal about this and the agent told me that I couldn't access the money unless I supplied a bank account number. I told her that wasn't OK and that I wanted the money either applied to future purchases, applied as a credit to one of the two credit cards I had on file, or sent to me in the form of a check. She said no and advised that she would refund the money to the sender, XXXX XXXX, and that XXXX could send me the money some other way. Following this call, I contacted XXXX and explained the situation and asked that, if she were to get the promised refund, could she please just send me a check. A week or so went by and I heard nothing, so I checked my PayPal summary page again to see if the refund took place. It had not- {$50.00} still "" waiting ''. 

I called PayPal again, reiterating my prior complaint and voicing my displeasure with the preceding experience, and the agent who helped me assured me that the situation was resolved and that my next purchase would "" tap '' the {$50.00}. So, on XX/XX/2021, I made another XXXX purchase in the amount of {$22.00}, expecting to see the {$50.00} decremented. Again, this did not happen. 

So, again, I called PayPal and yet another agent told me that, in order to have access to my money, I needed to set up the "" cash account '' or "" link a bank account ''. There was, he said, no way to send a check ( even though the website had a "" send a paper check instead '' button ) or put the money against my existing credit cards. I told him that I did not want to give out my bank account number and/or my complete identity ( full legal name, address, social security number, last four of the social security number, and date of birth ) just to access money someone else had sent me. I indicated that my money was basically a XXXX to PayPal 's XXXX  for personal information and that I didn't like that and would communicate this to the regulatory authorities ( that being you ). 

Just around the first of XXXX, XXXX, I was contemplating writing to you about this issue, but I decided to give PayPal another call because each time I had called previously, there was a new twist from the agent on the phone. So I called again, and this fourth time, the agent seemed much more sympathetic to my complaint, indicating that he had heard this many times before. After considerable back and forth, he said that the option to choose how to pay was displayed when I entered the "" Pay with PayPal '' screen at the time of purchase- that this would be visible as "" Source of Funds ''. He implored my to try that on the next purchase and said that, if access to the {$50.00} was not successful after that, I should call again and they would "" cut me a check ''. So yesterday, I went on XXXX and attempted to purchase some literature for {$18.00} plus shipping. When I went to pay with PayPal, I attempted to located the "" Source of Funds '' choice to which this agent had eluded. It wasn't there. I cancelled the purchase and called PayPal again today with this whole story, asking this time to speak with a supervisor. I was told that the {$50.00} I had available could only be had if I provided the personal information they wanted, otherwise they would just keep it. 

After this, I went back on XXXX and bought my literature and paid directly with my credit card, thus bypassing PayPal altogether. Following the purchase, I attempted to locate a number for the PayPal Corporate offices to voice my complaint higher up the food chain, but the number supplied online eventually took me back to the same "" customer service '' place I had been to so many times before, where the agent again said the the {$50.00} would be held pending the disclosure of the information they wanted. I again repeated that I wanted the money applied to future purchases, put back on the credit card ( s ) I had already on file, or sent via check. She refused. 

It was at this point that I contacted your office to request assistance and was told to submit this complaint. Your representative mentioned that there were "" thousands '' of complaints against PayPal but that she didn't know if any were exactly my issue. 

What I want is my {$50.00}. They can apply it to future purchases ( the preferred method ), credit it to the credit card I have on file, or send me a check for the money. 

What I want for everybody is for this practice to be disclosed up front. Had I known that the money that I was offered via PayPal would be held XXXX for personal information, I would not have agreed to accept payment via PayPal. I suspect that had the sender known this, she might have offered to pay a different way. PayPal needs to get agreement from all parties BEFORE the money changes hands. I think that if all parties are aware of this crazy policy, fewer will be likely to offer payment via or accept payment from PayPal. 

One final note : I am willing to supply to you any necessary information, including my login information so that you can see the trail for yourself. Please simply let me know if I can assist in any way. Please note that PayPal states that all calls are recorded and that "" notes '' are kept by their representatives when customer service calls are received, so PayPal will be the repository of all related documentation and conversation regarding this matter.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, CitiBank/Sears issued a Sears Mastercard to someone in my name using my social security number and a different date of birth. I had identity theft in the past and have an active 7 year alert in place with all XXXX credit agencies. The alert says to call me at my phone number before approving. Sears did not do this. Rather the agent on the phone explained that Sears used another means of validating my identity by answering some security questions from my credit report. Sears is now going to issue me the card then cancel it and credit me the approx. {$700.00} in fraud against them. 

There should be some sort of penalty or fine for companies that call the number when there is an active fraud alert on the credit record. I find it very frustrating that Citibank/Sears can approve credit in minutes but thats 45 days to remove the record from my Credit Report.

Today I learn that I have three late fees assessed totally {$54.00} to my account as follows : XX/XX/XXXX ; XX/XX/XXXX ; and XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by a customer service representative today, that the reason for my late fees are being charged because I paid the monthly installments late ( past the 10 day grace payment period ). However, I checked my records and note that Hyundai Finance payment information is incorrect. I confirmation number of my payments being made within 6 days from my payment grace period.

"Managing, opening, or closing your mobile wallet account","Dear PayPal XXXX XXXX, I am writing this complaint to appeal the permanent limitation that was placed on my PayPal account ( email address : XXXX ). I believe that this limitation was placed by mistake, and I would like to request that PayPal re-investigate my case and consider restoring my account if possible. 

Firstly, I want to emphasize that I have not violated any PayPal policies. I have always used my account in accordance with PayPal 's terms and conditions. I have never engaged in any fraudulent activity, nor have I conducted any transactions that could be considered suspicious or unlawful. 

Despite my compliance with PayPal policies, my account was permanently limited, which has caused me significant inconvenience and financial loss. I strongly believe that this limitation was a mistake, and I am eager to have PayPal re-examine my case to rectify this error. 

I would like to request that PayPal reconsider my account status and restore it to full functionality. I understand that PayPal has a duty to protect its users, and I fully support this goal. However, I believe that my account was unjustly restricted, and I am willing to cooperate fully with PayPal 's investigation to resolve this issue. 

In conclusion, I respectfully request that PayPal re-evaluate my account and take the necessary steps to restore my account to full functionality. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Arizona XXXX Date of Birth : XX/XX/1988 SS # : XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally dispute the accuracy and legitimacy of certain items on my credit report, as well as to raise concerns about potential violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) committed by the creditors involved. These matters have significantly impacted my financial well-being and personal life. I am seeking your assistance in addressing these issues and enforcing my rights under the law. 

Creditor Details and Violations : XXXX. XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX  **Account Number** : XXXX **Violations** : Potential violations of FCRA Sections 1681s-2 and 1681i.

2. [ Additional Creditor Details and Violations ] **Details of Violations and Personal Impact : ** Upon a recent review of my credit report, I came across several accounts that have raised concerns. Notably, the account labeled under the creditor "" XXXX XXXX, '' with an account number of XXXX, has raised particular alarm. Despite my efforts, I can not identify or recognize this business, nor can I establish any connection with the alleged debt. This has prompted serious doubts about the accuracy and legitimacy of this account. 

My attempts to engage with the creditor and resolve this matter have been met with insufficient responses. I believe that the situations I am facing represent violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Specifically, I believe the following sections have been violated : 1. **Section** : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - **Subsection** : 1681s-2 - **Violation** : Failure to conduct a reasonable investigation of disputed information. 

XXXX. **Section** : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) - **Subsection** : 1681i - **Violation** : Failure to provide accurate information and properly investigate disputes. 

**Personal Impact : ** I would like to share a deeply personal narrative that underscores the emotional and financial impact that these situations have had on my life. As an individual who has consistently demonstrated responsible financial behavior, the sudden emergence of these unfamiliar accounts has thrown my life into turmoil. The uncertainty surrounding these matters has resulted in heightened stress and anxiety, threatening my financial stability and hindering my ability to secure favorable credit terms. 

The repercussions of these events have reached beyond finances, affecting my mental well-being and straining relationships within my family. The emotional toll of navigating this challenging period can not be overstated, and I find myself at a crossroads that necessitates swift resolution.

**Resolution Request : ** I humbly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau utilize its authority to enforce relevant legal provisions and ensure that the creditors promptly address these violations. Specifically, I urge the creditors to remove the unverified accounts from my credit report, including the account labeled under the name "" XXXX XXXX  '' with the account number XXXX. This course of action is indispensable in restoring my financial reputation and alleviating the XXXX XXXX that has accompanied this ordeal. 

Recognizing the pivotal role that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau plays in safeguarding consumer rights, I wholeheartedly trust that your intervention will guide me towards a resolution that aligns with the principles of fairness and accuracy upheld by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

I extend my sincere gratitude for your attention to this matter. Eagerly awaiting your response and the subsequent steps toward resolving this dispute.

On our first loan in the past we attached XXXX notes to XXXX consecutive bills that were sent into Sallie Mae for the purpose of instructions on how to apply payment to our loan. We had paid over the minimum amount and the excess had not been applied to principle. The purpose of the notes was to instruct Sallie Mae to apply the extra to principle so that the loan could be paid down quicker.

After talking with someone on the phone I was told that excess funds are kept in an account so that if a payment is missed or under the minimum this account will make up the difference.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I got a loan from a company called prosper. I got approved on line for the amount of { {$20000.00} } they charged me a { {$1000.00} } fee for the application fee transfer of the cash when they sent the money Directly into my checking account. 
I was already stuck with the fee but I had the loan and was ready to go, but then they made me set up my first payment back to them before moving forward. This is when I realized that their statements I was told and presented to online, in very colorful low numbers Get Low Rates Pay at your Own Pace Save Money with no Hidden Fees the Highest Risk Rating said it was only 11.68 % was all a smoke screen, after it was too late. 

I now had already paid a { {$1000.00} } Hidden feel, I now have to make monthly payments of { {$570.00} } for the next 60 months ( But I thought I got to pay at my own pace? ) and then the worst things happens and they hide this really well in your account, I notice they are charging me over 26.57 % in interest ( not the Highest Rating interest of 11.68 % as advertised ) - so here I am and now I start reading every little detail and theres no way out of it, theres no changes allowed, theres no negotiations allowed, they literally screwed me. I was under the impression they were helping me with a debt consolidation/personal loan and now Im paying more than I was before. 

I still had hope they would understand the miscommunication and we can negotiate on my behalf to get this fixed but prosper refused to bring my rate down and they said they dont work with other debt consolidation companies either and I have no choice but to pay the 26.57 % rate. 

Im sure now they will find a way to ruin my credit score too and put on a delinquent payment account because I wont agree to auto pay. 

They still have never sent a contract or a monthly statement, like I said I didnt know how much interest they were charging because they make it hard to find.

There have been no business expenses through tis account, it is the account that every single personal bill for the entire farm/household are paid through this account. Additionally, the monies in this account are all the proceeds from a life insurance policy, and the account in question receives the Social Security Survivor Benefits for my youngest child. Looking back at the account for XXXX months there are ZERO business expenses, and there is no recourse through USAA. Most problematically, I have no access with no warning to the funds in this account, and the representative from USAA was unable to advise what happens to the outstanding payments scheduled through their bill pay system, outstanding checks, and certainly no regard for the fact that the direct deposit took almost a month to set up, requiring a daily phone call for every business day of an entire month, and a month to set it up. Not sure what their criteria is for business activity, but they have no sense of a farm as a business, this account is not used for business, and closing it will require paying fees to USAA and reordering checks on a new account that would operate exactly the same way because it is a household personal account. Would be very happy to go item by item on the expenditures of this account, but would like to have the check order for this account refunded and to be on record that this is a personal account.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,7397731
Managing an account,"Submitting a complaint about the rediculous lack of response I am getting from HSBC. I tried to open a new checking account ( my first banking relationship with HSBC ) with HSBC, making my initial {$500.00} deposit on XX/XX/XXXX, and then roughly {$3400.00} was deposited 2x/month via direct deposit starting XX/XX/XXXX, meeting the terms of a new account promotion offered by HSBC. Note - it took about a month from the time I requested the new account before it was created for me - not fraudulent, but really bad service. This in itself may be worth looking into as I dont know if there is some sort of accounting advantage related to how they time recognizing new accts. I inquired about when the new acct premium would be applied, and they sent a secure message on XX/XX/XXXX noting it takes 8 weeks to apply after earned. I gave them ample time to confirm I had met all requirements, and allowed 8 weeks, when I re-inquired in XXXX about the status of my new acct premium. I received a secure message on XX/XX/XXXX that they submitted my inquiry to their "" Campaigns & promotions '' department for review and would need 7-10 biz days to compete their research. it is XX/XX/XXXX today ; how are those 7-10 days looking? I've reinquired every month, and received secure messages on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX, with each referring to some area of their company working on this. This is a simple research exercise - what were the terms of a promotion that was in effect, and did the customer meet those terms - if no, explain you are sorry and why you cant award the premium ... ..if yes, apologize for the delay and award the premium. This is not hard, and this is not a small company. I must therefore conclude that this company is purposely delaying awarding the {$750.00} new account premium that is due, and there is no reason to believe they are singling me out - this is likely happening to many customers who observed HSBC 's offer, responded and complied in good faith, and are now either battling to get the award they were promised or have simply given up and have been cheated out of what they earned. HSBC makes too much money to nickel dime customers this way, and I'm hoping the CFPB can impose its will to review their new account award advertising, fulfillment, and research processes as you may find gross sloppiness, but I suspect you will instead find proceduralized fraud. I thank you very much for any support you can provide in this effort, both for the fraud I have encountered, and that which I am very confident is happening to other HSBC customers.",,3892966

"Managing, opening, or closing account","On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I received an email from American Express Serve notifying me, that they would start charging a monthly {$4.00} fee to keep the account open. After receiving the email I decided to cancel the card and logon onto my online account. 

After logging into my online account I attempted to close the account but was blocked from being able to do so, as their computer system then required me to respond to an additional verification email. I waited several minutes but never received a verification email which I could respond to. 

I then called their customer service number at XXXX and spoke with an agent whom I provided personal verification information ( SS #, DOB, Address ) and requested to close the account several times over the phone. The agent refused and stated that I had to first respond to the verification email ( which I have yet to receive ). We spoke on the phone for several minutes while he attempted to send multiple emails which continued not to arrive. I again requested that he close the account for me over for phone and the request was refused. The agent stated I would have to wait for the email to arrive, I asked if there was any other way I could close the account he said no. 

At this time I do not know if I will be able to close the account and am concerned about being charged penalties and late fees.

Late fee,"I have American Express ( Amex ) as a corporate card for work to cover travel and travel related expenses plus printing expenses. We also use American Express Travel Services. 
Our Amex expenses populate to a dashboard that we employees use. All charges populate except cash advances that I never use anyway. As employees we are required to code all of our expenses with specific codes for different customers. 
I had a complicated travel event last year with cancellations and ticket exchanges. When all of the charges came in I called Amex for clarification so I could code the line items correctly. There was some ambiguity and XXXX customer service rep insisted on putting a dispute on XXXX of the airline charges even though I made it clear I was not disputing, just trying to identify the charge. Subsequently I did identify the charge and submitted it for payment. Amex accepted this payment, and then later charged the same amount again when they removed their charge dispute from the account. I did not see this because, not having travelled in months I did not check statements or the dashboard because no new charges had been made. 
Then in XXXX they emailed me and said my account was delinquent {$920.00}, and they insisted on a XXXX payment of the same amount. After having to raise this with my manager it was submitted again. Actually paid for twice. I could not get any clarity on this and no XXXX on my employer 's side wanted to deal with it. 
This month the same thing happened again. This time in the amount of {$440.00}. This was associated with another disputed ticket. This had also been paid in full. In this case I was certain I had asked them not to dispute the charge. Again they were paid a second time for the same charge by my employer against my protests. 
To date they have double charged my employer twice and now they are charging me a late fee. 
Talking to them on the phone, they sometimes admit that they double charged me. Sometimes they deny it and say that its payment for crediting the account. This makes no sense because paying in full each time would zero out any credit. I have found the payment for the flight that my employer made and the XXXX billing in my Amex statements but they are unwilling to look at the evidence, will not provide an email address, and talk in circles. I explain the XXXX charging and they ask me to explain it over and over again. 
Their accounting treatment of this is not clear, and runs counter to a basic understanding of arithmetic. They insist that I reconcile the account. The dates and descriptions of their charges in their statements do not match the dates that they populate to my company 's portal for expense processing. This makes identification of the exact line items next to impossible. Then when I have identified the actual lines where they made the mistake ( reconciliation ) they refuse to look at it. This incident has cost me over XXXX hours dealing with them and my company, has been arbitrary, embarrassing and humiliating, and has disturbing to my peace and interferes with my ability to do my job. After all of this they are charging me a late fee. And this seems to be triggered anytime a charge is disputed, and this can happen with or without the card holder 's approval. 
I think they should have to wave the late fee at least, should probably reimburse my employer, and I think they should be investigated for a pattern of abusive behavior.",,1328270

I have been forced to pay $ XXXX a month to Experian and XXXX to track the status of their reviews and my accounts which have been repeatedly incorrect and in the case of at least XXXX account the incorrect balance cycled multiple times from {$14.00} to {$1000.00} all the while never being anything but {$0.00} for more than 30 days. I have now noticed twice that Experian has suddenly reduced my credit score by as much as XXXX points because first they do n't notice I have XXXX remaining personal loans ( XXXX auto loan, XXXX unsecured loans ). Then their own system explains they are deducting points from my score for having XXXX or XXXX personal loans. I have called twice on this matter. No one can explain why one part of their system says I have XXXX personal loans ( correct ) while the FICO score system reports I have currently XXXX personal loans ( incorrect ). Once their system does this, it is always a matter of 48 hours before myFICO reports the credit score deduction. I will attach a document to my complaint showing on their website the report of XXXX personal loans. It is not acceptable to me that I restructure my debt to gain control over {$1700.00} a month in income only to have my credit worthiness misrepresented by Experian who charges me a monthly fee of more than {$20.00} for the pleasure of making me chase them to report valid information.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2176787

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I am trying to get my loan modified and Shellpoint has been asking for documents from me continually but refuses to cancel my sale date of XX/XX/XXXX.
<P/>
The requests being made daily are an attempt to keep me from having a "" complete package '' and therefore, can not cancel my sale date.
<P/>
Since XX/XX/XXXX I started again with another "" updated packet '' with their "" lists '' of request to which I have always promptly submitted back only to have this process dragged out with a sale date pending.
<P/>
My compliant is that I am calling in on a daily basis to get the sale date cancelled only to be confronted with more ridiculous requests along with the fact that they take so long that my documents need to be updated, which I should not be penalized as not having documents in if they drag it out too long, but they have.
<P/>
For example, I have given Shellpoint Profit and Loss Statements for months now, and 3 times since XX/XX/XXXX only to be told today that they want me to subtract the Income from the Expenses and put totals under "" net '', which they have always asked me not to in the past. They asked me to "" write the date '' next to my signature even though the date was clearly typed at the top of an explanation letter to begin with. They have added requests before even looking at the documents I have sent in, then stating I have an incomplete file but after speaking to a representative can locate the documents by date and resolve most "" incomplete '' issues, ( but its up to me to figure it out not Shellpoint ). The new "" made up requests '' are impossible to guess and keep fulfilling. They wanted me to add XX/XX/XXXX to the XXXX form and then stated I put XX/XX/XXXX when in fact the XXXX was the line between the XX/XX/XXXX! Anything to allow them not to cancel the sale date which has gotten me so upset that I am filing a complaint.
I do not trust them and feel that their complete incompetence is setting me up to lose my home on XX/XX/XXXX. If I can not get them to accept my documents as "" complete '' soon they will then deny me stating that I did n't get my documents in within 37 days before the sale date so I am very concerned. What are the "" required documents '' that I need to have in to them that would qualify as a complete package, as they have had literally months and months of documents given to them but are never satisfied.
<P/>
Here is my basic package of what I have given them, many times over. But their added requests continue, plus change daily, plus expire as they take too long to process as completed, which is out of my control. They are DUAL TRACKING as I am trying to comply with all of their requests but I can not seem to ever arrive at a complete packet!

Trouble using your card,". COMPLAINT to CFPB Ive had this account with Capital One since XX/XX/XXXX ( 20 years ) in excellent standing, with no adversity ever. Ive received complimentary messages and had a good relationship with Capital One. 
Recently I contacted Capital one to dispute charges on XX/XX/XXXX - {$40.00} and early XX/XX/XXXX- {$4.00}. I spoke with the customer service agents and both disputes were resolved efficiently and quickly with credits issued back to my account. ( Also, I always received notices of these and all communications by US mail, email, and my account secure messages ) Contrary to what I was told later during this deceptive tactic mentioned later in this letter. ( We cant send you any written notification ) I contacted Capital One in XX/XX/XXXX about the {$4.00} dispute, for security reasons, I mentioned to the agent that I had not received my new card. Usually, a new card is mailed out about a month before expiration date ( XXXX ). After they checked my account and saw no reason my card to be delayed, I was told it should reach me soon. Since that time, Ive made several calls to Capital One inquiring about not receiving my new card. Each time I first spoke to a polite and understanding agent who saw no reason I shouldnt get my new card. The agent would put me on hold and after a long wait, a new person would come on and ask for my Social Security # and birthdate. I wasnt comfortable giving that information and informed them, my info is available in my account. They kept me on the phone long periods of time. This behavior appeared suspicious and irregular. I was assured they were employees of Capital One. Consequently, after many calls and long waits and frustration, I was told they would not be renewing my card. I asked why I have received no written notification. Why my available credit is still available and why the card and account are still active? I continued using my card and making my payments as I continued to get messages and regular notices of perks, commendations, and thank you for being a valued customer and the manner I kept my account. ETC. During each call, I continued to ask, why have you not sent me notification of adversity and what resource was used to deny me use of my account of 20 years ( my account is still open after 60 days ) I cant use it. 
I was told they could not send me notifications, letters, or answer my questions. 

I got no answers. Next, I wrote to Capital One Corporate Office ( XXXX XXXX ) to report the suspicious activity, ( for fear of hacking and scamming ), and asked if they would please have an agent call me to allow me to give names and times of agents and to further explain my concerns of suspicious actions. I got no response. 
Consequently, I believe Capital One used deceptive, unfair, irregular, tactics that violated my rights as a consumer. I also believe they had intent to purposely do me harm by not closing my account while failing to renew. I believe they will attempt to close my account for reason of fault by me and claim no activity for a long period of time. When in essence, I cant use it because the expiration date prevents me from using it. ( Declined for date expiration ) Their action will also affect my FICA score ( down to XXXX in XXXX on Capital One ) as well as possibility make me less trustworthy to creditors. There are no adversities on my credit report. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received US mail from Capital One dated XX/XX/XXXX ( copy attached ) This letter also seems suspicious. The letter seems like a fraud and asks me to submit my SS #, Name, and date of birth. Not only do I believe my consumer rights are violated, but I also believe these actions should be investigated. I dont dare call Capital One because I fear I may not be reaching Capital One. The actions by Capital One caused me hardship as I explained in my letter to Corp. 
The normal numbers to reach Capital One are : XXXX ( my card ), XXXX ( statement ), both dispute XXXX. On the last letter of ( XX/XX/XXXX ) asking for personal XXXX I have never seen the last number on Capital One. 
I have respectfully paid the account in full. 
Can you please assist me in this matter? I can be contacted by email or phone. 
Thank You,",,4718601

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I received a loan from Care Credit ( Synchrony Bank ) to pay for dental work. I was told there was 12 months interest free. I was provided a "" minimum payment amount ''. I believed the minimum payment amount would satisfy the loan during the interest free period. Turns out that was not the case and at the end of 12 months, there was a small balance remaining however interest was applied to the original balance, compounded over the full year and added to the account in a lump sum which almost doubled the amount that was due. This practice is misleading, deceptive and abusive to say the least. Had I been told what the minimum payment amount was to avoid the interest, I would have been satisfied. The purposefully provide a minimum amount which will leave a balance so they can tag you with extra interest charges. If interest was applied to the remaining principle amount after the 12 months and going forward, I would understand but their business practice is designed to gouge people for extra costs and fees.

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California XXXX Date of Birth : XX/XX/2001 SS # : XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal dispute and seek your valuable assistance in enforcing my legal rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), and other applicable consumer protection laws. The discrepancies and violations I have encountered in my credit reports are profoundly affecting my financial stability and overall quality of life. 

I am no stranger to the hardships that life can bring, but I am determined to provide a stable and secure future for my family. My journey, however, has been marred by the inaccurate reporting and unjust practices of creditors, leading to a seemingly insurmountable uphill battle. I have faced numerous challenges, but the violations outlined below have pushed me to the brink. 

Inaccurate Reporting of Payment History by XXXX XXXX and XXXX : As a diligent consumer, I reviewed my credit reports meticulously, only to discover that both XXXX XXXXXXXX ( Account Number : XXXX ) and XXXX  ( Account Number : XXXX ) have inaccurately reported late payment history on these accounts. The dream of purchasing a home for my family, a symbol of stability and security, has been indefinitely deferred due to the adverse credit terms I am now facing. These inaccuracies have not only impacted my creditworthiness but have also eroded my sense of hope and emotional well-being.

Violation : Reporting inaccurate information regarding the payment history of accounts.

Applicable Law : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Relevant Section : Section 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) of the FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ). 
Failure to Note Disputed Account by XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Account Number : XXXX ) has neglected to acknowledge that this account was in dispute within the mandated 30-day period. This oversight, a clear violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), has not only intensified my frustration but has shattered my belief that my rights as a consumer would be upheld. 

Violation : Failing to note that account XXXX was in dispute within the stipulated 30-day period.

Applicable Law : Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) Relevant Section : Section 807 ( 8 ) of the FDCPA ( 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 8 ) ).

Unauthorized Credit Inquiries : My privacy has been invaded by numerous unauthorized credit inquiries, including but not limited to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX The anxiety and fear of potential identity theft, coupled with the violation of my personal space, have left me feeling exposed and vulnerable. 

Violation : Unauthorized credit inquiries without permissible purpose.

Applicable Law : Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) Relevant Section : Section 604 of the FCRA ( 15 U.S. Code 1681b ).

These violations of the FCRA, FDCPA, and related laws have taken a severe toll on my emotional and mental well-being. The stress, XXXX and sleepless nights I endure have become a constant reminder of the uphill battle I am facing. The vision I had for providing stability and security for my family has been clouded by circumstances beyond my control.

In light of these violations, I respectfully request your prompt intervention to rectify these issues and enforce my legal rights. Specifically, I implore you to ensure the following actions are taken : XXXX XXXX and XXXX must rectify their inaccurate reporting of payment history on accounts XXXX and XXXX to restore my creditworthiness. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX must amend their record to accurately reflect that account XXXX was in dispute within the stipulated 30-day period, as required by the FDCPA. 
All unauthorized credit inquiries, as mentioned above, must be promptly removed from my credit reports to restore my privacy and protect me from potential identity theft. 
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the emotional turmoil and distress these violations have caused me. I urge you to use your authority to ensure that creditors and credit reporting agencies adhere to the law and protect consumers like me. I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to your prompt response and resolution of these issues. 

Thank you for your dedication to upholding consumer rights and promoting fairness in the financial system.

Why would you deny anyone whos asking for help while there in a crises. They put it of on FHA saying it was FHA that denied the modification because I wasnt enough months behind on my Mortgage. I dont know what is the truth at this point. This is the far most worse Mortgaging Company I have ever seen and I owned a house before I became home owner of this house.

Late fee,"I closed my credit card account with Citi on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid the account balance in full on XX/XX/XXXX.The last statement was due on XX/XX/XXXX so I now realize this was late. I was charged interest of {$3.00} and a late fee of {$25.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( the day after I paid the account balance in full and two days after the XXXX statement was due ). Of course I did not realize I was charged because I did not know the bill was paid late and I had though that I had paid the account balance in full ( not just the statement amount ). Since then I 've been charged an additional late fee of {$25.00} and an additional interest charge of {$0.00}. I asked them to please remove the late fees since this was clearly a misunderstanding, I had never paid a bill late before, and had already attempted to close the account. Citi told me that they can not waive the late fees because my account was closed. I feel that I am being penalized for closing the account. The terms also say : "" The amount of your late fee will never be higher than your Minimum Payment Due '' which is not true in my case since the minimum would have been the interest charged. Also, I was told that my account did not have "" Courtesy Late Fee '' removal because I earned miles using the card ( though other Citi cards do ) and that is not listed in the terms of agreement.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2411130

Multiple phone calls to validate debt was not returned with any written documentation of debt, Their office simply stated on the phone that the matter was an issue related to a judgment entered in XXXX XXXX and gave me the case file to get my own documentation. I later learned the judgment was vacated in XXXX and I had the judgment vacated again in XXXX. The plaintiff pursued the matter after the second vacated judgment even though it knew it had not provided any documentation to the validity of the debt after 2 months of legal action. They sought and were rewarded additional time by the courts to delay my proper remedy by the court which incurred XXXX trips more than necessary t defend the matter and to obtain satisfaction in regards to my counterclaim. Although I submitted all documentation necessary to prove that I had actual damages, the plaintiff lacked any meritorious defense the judge determined that the case lacked sufficient documentation to prove wrong doing. First according to FDCPA the collection agent is to submit documentation to validity of debt, I proved that the plaintiff submitted no documentation to support claim to debt, not within the original 14 days of request or the entire court case history in XXXX. Secondly, the collection agent pursued legal action without any consultation about the debt with consumer prior to seizing assets. Third, the seizure of assets was committed using FALSE information obtained from ecourts XXXX system which validated a history of a judgment but not the status of the judgment. The assignee did not validate the debt by requesting history of payments or original documentation of contractual obligation prior to seizure. Fourth, Plaintiff submitted a false document as authentic in the submission of the restraining notice to the XXXX legal offices which is a violation of New York State Criminal Law. Fifth, the plaintiff 's attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, which acted as the Collection agent committed an act of fraud and a violation of professional conduct by not validating the status of the judgment since the ecourts XXXX system stated to "" See File '' for status of the original judgment. It was within their purview to validate prior to proceeding with legal action. Finally, the judgment was vacated twice by the court after multiple attempts to validate the authenticity of debt. The vacated stated was granted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX. The plaintiff had ample time and opportunity to reduce the injury to defendant by doing proper processing of the court case 's documentation instead they requested two adjournments to prepare for the case which further injured the defendant by requiring multiple visits to an out-of-state- court to provide defense for her suit against the illegal actions of the plaintiff.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2190296

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"On XX/XX/XXXX, at approximately XXXX, PST, I called Chase Business Credit Card Services XXXX I inquired about their 5/24 rule, consumers will be denied credit if theyve opened 5 new credit accounts within 2 years. I wanted to know if the same rule applied for business credit cards.

I said, so since youre not familiar with the 5/24 rule and you work in the business credit dept, it doesnt apply? She said, no, it doesnt. Based on Chases business credit card reps admonition whose job is to answer cardholders questions and potential card holders questions to the best of her ability, a decision was made to apply for their XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card and I was immediately declined. If I was given correct information from their business credit card rep, I would have NEVER applied for their card when I have opened more than 5 new accounts within the past two years. The decision to apply for Chases credit card was not wholly based on me. The decision was based on INCORRECT information received from a paid employee, who I assumed, was trained to furnish cardholders and non-cardholders with correct answers to their inquiries. Once I was declined, I called and spoke to another Chase representative. I asked WHY I was declined, she looked up my application and said I was DECLINED because I have opened 5 NEW ACCOUNTS within 2 years! I asked to speak to a supervisor to inform them of my experience with the previous rep who gave me false information that was used, trusting that it was correct, to apply for their business credit card. I waited on the phone for over ten minutes to speak with a supervisor and no one came back to the phone. I called again, at approximately XXXX, XXXX XXXX Chase Business Credit card answered my call. His customer service was not less than deplorable! He spoke to me in a condescending tone, lecturing and adding more aggravation to the issue. I asked to speak this his supervisor. XXXX did not immediately transfer me to his superior without adding more insult to injury. Supervisor XXXX came on the phone. His attitude and customer services was almost as bad as XXXX. Overall, I did not get the help I sought. I called Chase to ask that the credit inquiry be deleted from my consumer report, seeing that I was given incorrect information from one of their representatives. The incorrect information was used to help in the decision to apply for credit that I was was denied. If furnished with the correct information I would not have applied for their card. Now, there is a inquiry on my consumer report, without being offered credit. 

If a credit card company places an inquiry on your report and doesnt offer credit, according to : 15 U.S. Code 1681b- Permissible purposes of consumer reports ( c ) ( 1 ) A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report relating to any consumer pursuant to subparagraph ( A ) or ( C ) of subsection ( a ) ( 3 ) in connection with any credit or insurance transaction that is not initiated by the consumer only if- ( B ) ( i ) the transaction consists of a FIRM OFFER OF CREDIT ....

For example, if a person makes a payment on the due date. XXXX  will not process the payment until a few days later and post the payment on the day they processed the payment ( not the day it was made ). Therefore, the customer incurs a late fee for a late payment.

A second scenario, a customer makes a payment 3 days prior to the due date. XXXX  still processes the payment after the due date and post the payment to their customers account after the due date. The customer still incurs a late payment fee, because XXXX  did not process the payment until after the due date, although the payment was made before the due date.

The payment system used does not seem stable and has had issues processing payments. Also, causing customers to keep trying to make a payment online and sometimes will cause the customer to be late. Or force the customer to submit a payment in an alternative method ( mail ) which will also cause the customer to incur late fees and a late payment.

XXXX also reports an account as "" Closed '' to the three Credit Agencies, even though the account is truly not closed by XXXX or the customer.",,3131439
"Managing, opening, or closing account","Unable to open an account. 

I purchased an American Express Blue Bird pre-pay debit card at XXXX, paid {$5.00} for the card, and loaded {$5.00} onto the card, with the intent of having the company send me a Permanent Card. The paperwork with the card says to register at XXXX I followed the directions and went to that site, entered all of my personal information, including my social security number. Each time I did this process, the page would respond slightly different, and sometimes would prompt me with verification questions relating to my vehicles, which looks like a normal verification process. 

I updated my web browser, thinking that maybe it needed a newer version of firefox. That did not improve anything. I tried several different combinations of the information. Sometimes it would prompt me to confirm a slight variation of my address, using N instead of north. 

No matter what I did, I always ended up at the Unable to Sign Up message. "" Sorry, we are unable to approve you for an Account at this time.Thank you for your interest in Bluebird. '' There was no reason given. Further, there was no customer service number given to call to resolve the issue. I tried to call the number on the back of the card, and it stated that I MUST use the online process to activate and that customer service can not do this process. 

During this process, while it may be encrypted, I sent my social security number, name, and birth date, at least 20 times across the internet. Most companies will prompt the user with an error message, such as "" please verify your "" XXXX '' is the correct information, if something is a typographical error. At one point I had wondered if I typed the birth date year with XXXX digits or XXXX. One of the questions it asked me about a vehicle was something I was uncertain of. I had a XXXX Buick, but I was not sure if it was a "" custom '' or not ... I presume they use a list of VIN numbers for that system, but manufacturers do n't always have the right VIN numbers attached to extensions of the car name. That could have caused confusion. I wonder where they get this from anyway, since I have opted out of the DMV in Wisconsin. 

Regardless, I have tried fruitlessly to have them send me a permanent card with my name on it that i can reload, and as far as I can find, there is no way to call them. 

So, I have spent {$5.00} for a worthless card, and have {$5.00} on a card ... .it cost me {$5.00} to put {$5.00} on a card, that I was supposed to be able to use as a reload product that I could use with XXXX , XXXX XXXX etc to buy stuff online. 

I have a XXXX card that works fine, though they have a software glitch that presumes that you bought a temporary card at the store, and then they were to send you a card. When you have them send you a temporary card in the mail, the system thinks you have been sent a permanent card, and it will not send you a permanent card, which is corrected by calling them and explaining the problem. 

But with Bluebird by American Express, I can not get a card that I can use as a re loadable debit card.",,2152508

Fraud or scam,"XXXX purchased a prepaid credit card in XXXX of 2009 for {$300.00} with Orchard bank. The bank increased the credit line to {$750.00} without my requesting the increase. I did not send additional funds to increase the limit. Within a short time the card or bank was sold to Capital One. I no longer need a prepaid credit line as my credit is ok. 

I called Capital One and wanted to close the account and have my {$300.00} refunded to me. Capital One says that the card came from Orchard bank to them without any secured portion on it. 
Capital One gave me numbers at Orchard to call but the numbers revert back to Capital One. 

I can give you my Capital One Credit Card number if it is needed but I am reluctant to do so due to security issues.

Delinquent account,"I was never late in paying my SpringLeaf credit card account. The account has autopay set up through springleaf and that has been the mode of payment for years.

I do n't know how they can justify destroying my credit over {$20.00}. Springleaf charged me a yearly fee of {$20.00} which I did n't even know about and then compounded late fees on top of it and reported me to the credit bureau.

Other creditors call or send email to make sure their customer is aware of a problem with their account. It is called good faith and Springleaf operated without a conscience. 
Because I assumed I owed nothing and if I did autopay would kick in, I did not know about any late payment until I pulled my credit in XXXX 2016. My credit score has dropped at least XXXX points because of {$20.00}! When I called springleaf they tried to force me to pay over {$70.00}. I refused to pay a fee I do n't agree with.

Late fee,"Dear CFPB. It has come to my attention recently that Bank of America had reported delinquencies to my XXXX credit reports for XXXX of 2014 after I paid my cards off in full at the branch for {$1200.00}. I was unaware that there was any more of a balance because I had not received my statement for XXXX. Unfortunately they had charged me interest on top of my annual fee that month and I was left unaware and had not received any phone calls or letters following up on this unfortunate situation. I was not given any tpe of grace period to make-up for the unseen payment and this has absolutely devastated my financial profile and I am now unable to financially do anything as this XXXX small lost statement has tanked my credit score. This is unbelievably unfair and I even sent Bank of America a long and detailed letter explaining my situation and the sad situation where their statement had not been received after I had paid the card off. I feel as though they have no sympathy or an understanding as to what I had to go through to find out that their interests and annual fees had accumulates unseen. This is simply not my fault, these things happen and I requested that Bank of America change their past due reporting because I had not received any warning phone calls, and heads up or any concern from them regarding this. I am and always have been a loyal customer and they sent me a letter claiming that I am repsobile for this late but I am absolutely not. Once it came to my attention at the branch that I had unseen balances on this card I made a large payment to cover it all. I am very financially responsible and this was not my fault. Even at the branch i was not told that I had any minimum payments to pay and I was aware that i had a zero balance after making a complete and full payment the month before. It is completely unfair that after a few days of not receiving a payment this company neither contacted me nor did they follow up with me, they simply sent me into default for that month. They have charged me over {$200.00} in fees that year and this is unheard of and I ca n't understand why. They did this and now i have a balance even higher than i suspected on a month where i received no statements or email regarding a payment that was due.

When I went to use it again last week ( XXXX XXXX, 2015 ), I called to get my balance and was told by Citi that my card had a balance of {$27.00}, but my card had expired at the XX/XX/2015 and that here was nothing that could be done to get my balance of {$2.00} I know that it is only {$27.00}, but I think it is highly unfair of Citi to have such a quick expiration date for their card ( XXXX months to use the card ). Most cards give you at least a year to use them, which is why I did n't check the expiration date on the card.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I applied for a loan with Spotloan on XX/XX/XXXX. They approved me for a {$500.00} loan with a lengthy repayment schedule and high repayment amounts. I called Spotloan to ask about the interest rate and how my payments would be applied to repaying the loan. I wanted to make sure I could pay it off quickly. I did not want to make payments til XX/XX/XXXX like the payment schedule showed. But I didnt know how my payments would go towards the principal and interest. 

The representative told me he couldnt tell me until after I had the loan. He said he couldnt see my interest rate and didnt know how my payments would be applied. He said I had to call back after I had paid he loan. So I waited and called back. Another representative told me I was being charged interest daily! The interest always made the amount owed more than my payments. Every time I made an online payment, my balance got higher. Furthermore, the balance they would email me didnt match the balance when I logged onto my online Spotloan account. 

My plan of paying this loan off quickly was ruined by the way they are handling the interest. I never would of accepted the loan if I knew my payments werent going towards paying off the loan.

Taking/threatening an illegal action,"The XXXX companies I am writing about have been relentless and dishonest in attempting to collect from me credit card debts that were generated during the XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX economic meltdown. That is when the clock started. According to the statute of limitations in California where I reside, these debts are past the statute of limitations period of four years. I was informed on Wednesday that one of these companies has obtained a judgment against me and will begin to garnish my wages effective XX/XX/XXXX, defying the laws of the state that clearly spell out that debt that is older than 4 years old can not be collected. In addition, this particular debt collection firm has filed suit against me ( documents enclosed ) These aggressive debt collectors have made it a mission to enforce debts that are barred by the statute of limitations. In good faith I negotiated with XXXX of the XXXX debt collecting companies a few years ago and I have been paying down this debt slowly. The other XXXX companies have been incessant in their continued pursuit. These are all open credit accounts debts and the debt collectors know that these debts are old and past the statute of limitations. They still proceeded to sue me. Now my professional reputation within the company I work for is very much negatively impacted, perhaps irreversibly. I have no idea what impact this wage garnishment issue will have on my future advancement chances and income earning potential. The imposed wage garnishment sums are so outlandish that I can not possibly stay financially viable ; I will crash. The XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX meltdown had terrible financial repercussions on my family and I. When people around me were declaring Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, I stuck it out and fought back in order to pay back loans. My house went into foreclosure three times and three times I saved it from this fate by providing mountains of bank-requested documentation, many times the day before the house went to auction. I am very proud of having achieved this. Unfortunately some of my debts went without recourse and I lamentably could not pay them back. I achieved new and promising employment XX/XX/XXXX and I was looking forward to a productive and contributory career advancement and now this. I find it appalling that the courts would allow for a lawsuit of this nature, in full knowledge that the cases fall outside of this state 's statute of limitations. My situation now is dire. After having fought back from the precipice more than once, I am besieged by an unlawful and unscrupulous turn of events. Mind you ; I successfully came back from the meltdown while dealing with both my mother and father 's illnesses and subsequent passing. I took care of them every day after work for four years. Would not have done it any other way. So kind folks, an act of God brought me to your website. Your mission statement and goals are so worthy I can not begin to express my sentiments.

Whatever happened to customer service? I have applied for a modification now many times and each time I was denied and the process would start all over again. Plus I am never told why I am being denied. So frustrating! I cant seem to get a break. Then I was told I qualified for a repayment plan but, after going through the agonizing process of applying for that I was denied for that, too. Who can help me? I have asked to speak with supervisors, managers and anyone with some authority but I get nowhere. I am getting desperate. I really hope you can help me. 

I am making good money now and I am finally starting to get back on my feet. My sister is now living with me and is helping out with the finances. She is also a hard worker and is committed to helping me keep my house. Together we have a comfortable life and would be devastated to have to move. I know I can make good on this loan if I can just get another chance and have some help in dealing with Carrington mortgage. I am sure there must be laws that protect and help someone like me. I am willing to apply for whatever program would get me started again and follow through with this if there really is hope that I can get the help I need.",,3070958

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"A letter addressed to my wife, dated XX/XX/XXXX from Navy Federal Credit Union XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX stating that a past due amount of {$12.00} needed to be paid to this Navy Federal Credit Union. Threatening statements indicated that late fees would be assessed, and information would be sent to the credit bureaus concerning late payments, missed payments, or other defaults might be reflected on her credit report. 

We called a toll free number to resolve this because my WIFE NEVER APPLIED FOR A CREDIT CARD from this credit union. We live in XXXX, ane we have never had any dealings with any credit unions. The first person we talked to said the following : A credit card had been issued to an XXXX XXXX at an address of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, with a credit limit of {$25000.00}! This credit card was opened on XX/XX/2016. The {$12.00} charge was a XXXX charge to ship the credit card to the applicant! 
Supossedly the nexy day, Navy Federal Credit became suspicious, and the account was put on hold. 

WE WERE NEVER MADE AWARE OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE ONLY NOTICE WE RECEIVED WAS THE LETTER DEMANDING PAYMENT OF THE {$12.00}! I asked why we were not contacted, an I was told that the PHONE NUMBER WAS INVALID. BUT NAVY FEDERAL COULD HAVE CONTACTED US BY MAIL! WE RECEIVED BILLS FROM NAVY FEDERAL WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS! 

We made several phone calls to the "" fraud department '' of Navy Federal Credit Union. I was completely stonewalled by supposed fraud executives named XXXX and XXXX. XXXX was rude, abrasive, offered no information, and interrupted us several times. Her last comment was we needed to talk to XXXX. When we tried to contact her she was unavailable. We left a message for her to call us back, but she never called back. 

In conclusion we consider this matter to be ignored and unresolved. It seems that this Navy Federal Credt Union was totally unconcerned with our questions. This appears to be a serious IDENTITY THEFT attack. We we trying to get all the information about this breach, and how it could be possible that this credit union could actually issue a credit card particularly one with such a high amount from a credit union in XXXX to an individual in XXXX without contacting persons that would be responsible for the charges on this credit card! We need as much information as possible in this matter so that we might contact authorities that might protect us. Obviously Navy Federal Credit Union has no interest in advising us at to actions we might take to protect us.

Opening an account,"After numerous complaints to and requests for information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding fraudulent transactions processed at a Branch Banking & Trust ( BB & T ), I have obtained documents demonstrating that BB & T opened at least one fraudulent joint account in my name without my authorization, knowledge, physical presence, or valid identification. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, BB & T opened a joint account ending in XXXX in my name at its XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, VA XXXX location. I was not physically present for this as I was serving as a XXXX XXXX XXXX in rural XXXX and BB & T transactions from my personal checking account ending in XXXX confirm that I made a withdrawal in XXXX, XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not know of or authorize the opening of the joint account ending in XXXX. The account signature card dates my forged signature as XX/XX/XXXX. I was, again, serving abroad and did not sign this document at any time. Furthermore, as I learned over the phone from BB & T 's Identity Theft unit, BB & T accepted a voided and therefore invalidated Colorado drivers license as proof of my identity. I would like to note that this license literally has holes punched through it spelling "" VOID '' and that I had maintained a Virginia drivers license for years prior to XX/XX/XXXX. 

This is in direct violation of FDIC Law, Regulations, Related Acts mandates in Miscellaneous Statutes and Regulations Part 1020 that banks must have a Consumer Identification Program ( CIP ) that contains procedures for verifying the identity of the customer, using information obtained in accordance with paragraph ( a ) ( 2 ) ( i ) of this section, within a reasonable time after the account is opened. Appropriate documents from an individual may include an unexpired government-issued identification evidencing nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard, such as a driver 's license or passport. As outlined above, BB & T accepted no such document. When a person other than an individual ( such as a corporation, partnership, or trust ) opens an account, the FDIC requires documents showing the existence of the entity, such as certified articles of incorporation, a government-issued business license, a partnership agreement, or trust instrument. At no time did I consent to or issue a trust instrument to another individual. 

The FDIC allots for verification through non-documentary methods and the bank 's non-documentary procedures must address situations where an individual is unable to present an unexpired government-issued identification document that bears a photograph or similar safeguard ; the bank is not familiar with the documents presented ; the account is opened without obtaining documents ; the customer opens the account without appearing in person at the bank ; and where the bank is otherwise presented with circumstances that increase the risk that the bank will be unable to verify the true identity of a customer through documents. I have not been provided with any evidence that BB & T pursued non-documentary verification as it maintained an invalidated drivers license as proof of my identity in relation to the joint account. 

This fraudulently-opened joint account ending in XXXX was used to deposit a check in my name on XX/XX/XXXX. This check, numbered XXXX, was in the amount of {$20000.00}. BB & T records confirm that I received a total of {$4000.00} from check number XXXX through a phone transfer from account ending in XXXX to account ending in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware that these funds were from a fraudulent joint account nor that they were from a check reissued under false pretenses in the amount of {$20000.00}. 

The joint account ending in XXXX was closed on XX/XX/XXXX without my awareness of its existence while I remained in XXXX. A closing balance of {$10000.00} was issued to the individual who closed the account. I did not receive this money. 

I am demanding an explanation as to how the account ending in XXXX was opened, acknowledgement of fraud, and swift reimbursement of check number XXXX. Additionally, I am demanding to know how many other accounts ( aside from those ending in XXXX and XXXX ) were opened in my name at BB & T and all correlating records. I would not be making these demands if BB & T had adhered to FDIC regulations and believe that the bank should be held accountable to the full extent of the law.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3007054

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","In XXXX XXXX I submitted a complaint regarding the mismanagement of my mortgage and escrow account as well as several foreclosure attempts made by JPMorgan Chase on my home. I hereby DISPUTE THE PREVIOUS RESPONSE BY JPMORGAN CHASE BANK TO MY CFPB COMPLAINT # XXXX, as I was not given sufficient time to dispute Chase 's response. Their reply consisted of a string of dates listed wherein they claim to have corresponded with me, stating I did not respond, and suggesting I had not complied. They did not mention the fact that I had timely and fully completed their RMA application at least three times since my first application for a loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX. Nor did they mention that a couple weeks after my XXXX SPOC called and told me all of my docs were finally in the underwriters hands and I should have a decision soon, they turned around and informed me I needed to resubmit a new RMA and all the supporting documents yet again as they had been using the WRONG SET OF INVESTOR GUIDELINES. After this fiasco I complied yet again, while they continued to demand repetitive documentation requirements, while scheduling foreclosure sales. Being fed up, I filed the first CFPB complaint. 
This is a direct violation of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as the California Homeowners Bill of Rights. They deny this, but of course never have to prove any of their false claims. The burden is only on me to prove anything, which I can and have done multiple times, while the bank still gets a pass on their own illegal and reprehensible behavior. 
I also complained to the Making Home Affordable team, who intervened several times on my behalf requiring Chase to postpone the trustee sales. The letter Chase published in response to my complaint was the same letter they sent responding to my MHA complaint, which substantiates absolutely nothing. They do not address their wrongful actions and dual tracking, other than to claim they did not do it. 
My original CFPB complaint was primarily to address the ongoing dispute over the property taxes and their mismanagement of my Escrow Account from inception of their servicing, which violates RESPA laws. Chase refuses to recalculate their innacurate amounts required in Escrow. Their continual response is they do n't have to correct their erroneous numbers because I am behind in my payments. ( a position they forced me into by improperly servicing my loan from the outset, and refusing to correct their erroneous numbers. This behavior is well documented in the National Mortgage Settlement, for which the big XXXX banks were fined XXXX collectively. Later, JPMorgan alone was fined another XXXX for more of the same crooked behavior. I believe they need to use the correct values in order to offer me a proper loan modification based on accurate accounting values. Am I expected to sign an offer that I know is prepared using false or incorrect data? 
Another legal matter that JPMorgan failed to address in my prior complaint is that I sent a certified QWR letter to them in XXXX XXXX, which they have still never answered to this day. For several months they sent me a letter requesting additional time to research almost every two weeks, and then after XX/XX/XXXX, they stopped responding completely. To date they have still not complied or answered my QWR letter, willfully violating the Dodd Frank requirement to respond to my questions within 30 days.

Late fee,"Three years ago, I had a dispute with Kohl 's Department Store regarding a fee that they applied to my Kohl 's charge card. I was not aware of the fee until I tried to make a purchase and was denied. I went to the customer service desk and was told that the fee was applied for a late payment. However, I had a XXXX balance, other than the late fee and as far as I know had never made any payments late. I objected to the fee in the credit office however the attendant claimed to be powerless to do anything. So, I paid it and requested that my account be closed. Last week I discovered that the account was not closed and it is affecting my creditworthiness today ... I was refused a business credit card due to this blemish.

Can't repay my loan,"I am a graduate of XXXX University and currently have multiple student loans with XXXX XXXX, now known as Navient. My student loans have now or are in the process of switching over to collections. I have tried to work with both XXXX XXXX and Navient to make payments under a financial payment plan. However, neither company wanted to work with me and came up with their own amount that they wanted me to pay for the loans, which was quite a lot for me. I was able to make a few payments of what they were wanting me to pay with automatic withdraws from my checking account. There was a few time that I would ask to just have my payment to be taken out a day or two later than the due date due to my paycheck date and they refused to do it. I would have insufficient funds and would be charged fees at my bank account, because they would n't push it back. They kept telling me that if I stayed on the payment plan I would go into good standing and I never was put into good standing even after being on this plan for a few months. My cosigner along with myself would send in payments, because they would send my cosigner papers stating I was late when I was not, so she would in turn send in more money to them. I have always said that the payments that we were posting were not posting correctly and they were just keeping our money. It was hard to verify that due to myself and my cosigner paying different times. When we called to ask they always justified the payments somehow. My student loans have sky high interest rates, even with my cosigner! The interest is still climbing and there is nothing they are willing to do to help me. I have tried to consolidate my loans with another company, but unfortunately my debit to income ratio will not allow me to do so. I have also asked the companies themselves to consolidate my loans and make one payment instead of individual payments, but they said they could not do that either. I have been forced to be but into deferment/forbearance before due to them not working with me during difficult times. I have often thought it would be easier to deal with a collection agency or to have them garnish my wages to have a cheaper payment. I should not have to feel that way with a company that was willing to help me further my education. XXXX XXXX ( Navient ), and the collection agency that my loans called XXXX XXXX XXXX have continuously been calling my employer, cosigner, and myself nonstop! I currently work at a doctor 's office and they have been told over and over again to stop calling the office by myself, co works, and office manager, but they continue to call!!! They have also send over multiple papers that they have requested my employer to fill out which they have and always do and yet they still continue to call me. I have tried to explain to them that my hours are the exact same as their hours are and the easiest way to get a hold of me is through email, but they will not communicate that they. It is very hard and frustration to work with a company that is not will to work with you on payments or even listen to you after you have been telling them not to do something and they continue to do it. My cosigner has tried to talk to them as well and work out something as far as payments go and they are unwilling to work with her either. My cosigner is in a fixed income, which they knew that, and they are requesting most of her income as a payment for the loans. If she was to pay it she would not have enough money to survive and they do n't care. My credit score has completely declined over the years due to this company reporting to the credits that payments are not made when they had been. I have plenty more I would like to complain about however we are limited of what we can say and in completely understand. If something could be done about these issues I would be forever grateful.",,2310642
Dealing with your lender or servicer,"After the CARES act went into effect in 2020, I called Navient on XXXX/XXXX/2020 to ask what I could do as I have 2 FFELP loans and they say federal in the title. I was told it's considered a private loan even though it's federal protected but it's not a federal student loan and that I didn't qualify under the CARES act. I asked if there was anything I could do to essentially have the loans to be considered a DE federal held/serviced loan. They said I can refinance my loans but that won't make them federal but it will make them private and may reduce my payments. 

I told them I did not want this option as that did not make sense for me to do. 

However, I just learned that I could have consolidated my 2 FFELP loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan which then would make them fully federal loans and as such this would have made me eligible for the CARES act and received the 0 % interest during this time and I could have not had to have been having to pay for my loans without penalty. 

I've been paying for the past 2 years with interest on something that I didn't have to if I was provided accurate information. Instead either by malicious design by the company ( to keep my loans with Navient and me paying ) or by accident ( agent truly was not educated or trained to this information ) and as such did not provide accurate and complete information to allow me to make an informed decision. I paid an additional {$2900.00} ( plus accrued interest ) in the past 27 months that I wouldn't have had to due to the CARES act. 

I'm very frustrated as if I had been informed of this option, I would have done just this back in XXXX of 2020 to save myself and my family money that we could have spent on our day to day living. 

I consolidated into a Direct loan this morning ( to be covered under the CARES act as well as the loan reduced under the Biden Administration 's Student Loan Debt Relief Plan ) but still upset that this should have been presented to me as an option back in 2020. That would have meant that I could have not had interest during this time ( increasing my student loan cost ) I would love for all the interest to be removed from my loan due to their inaccurate information. I called Navient to get answers, clarification, choices and was led astray and it costs us thousands.",,5957933

Late fee,"I am writing to complain about the refusal of Citi Bank to cancel interest and penalty charges improperly added to my Citi MasterCard account. 
I have had a Citi card for over twenty years. My practice has been to pay the full balance of the card every month, as shown on my printed statements, so I will not incur interest or penalty charges. During the last year, I have twice been required to cancel my card because of fraudulent charges, quite possibly as a result of inadequate security arrangements of Citi Bank. The second of these cancellations occurred XX/XX/2016. At the time, I paid Citi all amounts then properly due -- that is, the amounts for all purchases I had made, but not the fraudulent charges made by someone else -- and Citi removed those charges from my bill. Citi then sent me a new card, which I have not activated. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have made no charges and have had no working Citi card. 
After XX/XX/XXXX, without my permission, Citi stopped sending me printed statements for my expired card. I did not miss receiving these statements because I assumed that, my account having been cancelled after I paid all outstanding charges, no more was due. But Citi charged me for several purchases, totaling {$180.00}, that I had made but had not been posted to my account at the time the card was cancelled. I was unaware of those charges and so did not pay them. Citi then began adding interest and penalty charges to the amount they claimed. They now claim that I owe them {$320.00}, far more than the charges I actually incurred. {$180.00}. 
I received no adequate notification of these charges, interest, or penalties. Citi sent me only electronic notifications. I have all my bills arrive by hard copy. I receive dozens of email business solicitations every day, do not read them, and have never agreed to be billed electronically by Citi or anyone else. Citi sent me nothing in writing, and did not call to ask me why such a reliable customer had stopped paying. 
In addition, I had accumulated {$82.00} of Citi dividend dollars, which can be used toward one 's payment of a bill. Citi now claims that I have forfeited this {$82.00}, which I think is not proper. The entire situation happened as a result of the fraudulent use of my card and the need to cancel it. 
Citibank has refused even to consider removing the interest and penalty charges, which resulted from security breaches in my Citi account, and which I do not owe because I never received proper written notice of the sums originally due. Since I discovered this problem on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I have been told by XXXX different Citi representatives that they lack the power to make such adjustments. To speak with these representatives, I had to make at least seven telephone calls, during about half of which my connection to Citi was abruptly cut. One representative promised me that a supervisor would telephone me within 36 hours, but this did not happen. All in all, I have spent at least four hours on the phone trying to resolve this matter. I have offered to pay the full amount of the charges that I had made, {$180.00}, and to forfeit my {$82.00} in dividend dollars as well. Citi insists that all charges on the account including interest and penalties are mine and can not be removed. 
So far as I can tell from the credit card agreement, my only recourse against Citi at this point is to start arbitration proceedings, for which I would apparently have to pay a {$200.00} filing fee. Meanwhile, my failure to pay what Citi demands could damage my credit rating, which until now has been unimpaired. 
I am therefore requesting that Citi cancel all the interest and penalties they are now claiming, at which point I will be glad to pay the {$180.00} in underlying charges.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2049922

Closing an account,"On XX/XX/2020, Marcus by Goldman Sachs opened an account illegally online without my permission.

I called the company on XX/XX/2020 and spoke to four different  people regarding the fraudulent account. The names of the people XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and a specialist in the Fraud Department. I told them that a false, online savings account was opened in my name and I was upset that they would do this without actually doing some investigative work regarding the person being a robot, a thief or an actual, qualifying person. I was told that it doesn't take any money to open up an account and that is how most banks do their banking. I mentioned that all three credit monitoring companies have been frozen for several years and I also have XXXX  which when checked tells the banks of any identify theft problems regarding the account. After talking to several representatives of Marcus by Goldman Sachs, they said they will investigate and close the account. I am very wary that this account may not be closed and that is why I am submitting this complaint. What bothers me about banks letting accounts to be opened, they send a statement that you will be held responsible for this account, even though you did not open it. It takes the online person minutes to open and it takes me days or weeks to close these accounts.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I have lived in my house since XX/XX/XXXX purchase {$340000.00}. My princpal loan should be lower by now but my mortgage was a predatory morgage sold to me by Wells Fargo. The initial loan term was 6.75 % 30 years fixed interest only. Because the loan was predatory, we defaulted in the time of recession. When i requested for loan modification on the loan on or about XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo Charged me interest of {$19000.00}, before modifying my loan. While other banks forgave debt. What Wells Fargo did to my family is causing undue fininacial hardship and the bulk of my loan is left to be paid. Although we are far advance on the 30years payment we still have high principal balance {$270000.00}. What Wells Fargo did to us is unfair and predatory.

Can't repay my loan,"I attended the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, California.

Needless to say, no amount of money I would 've made leaving with an associate of arts degree could 've paid off those loans. I was told it would be no problem once I graduated, and since I come from a lower middle class family, furthering my education was a priority for a better life. Instead, 10 years later, my loan is in default, they seize my tax returns and I have XXXX children ages XXXX and XXXX who ask why we cant get a house or fix our car when it breaks. I actually had XXXX of their debt collectors say to me, "" you shouldve thought of that before you had children. '' They called my home and family relentlessly for years! I had a job from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX where my boss had to have several "" talks '' with me becuase she asked them to stop calling my place of employment and they wouldnt. I believe she was looking into contacting the XXXX or something of that nature, but she never followed through. I would like to note that I am an excellent XXXX. Any boss or co-worker I have ever had would back that up, so the problem leaving was not my skill, but rather the impossibility of repaying a loan of that amount. Its insane when I think back on it. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself from signing, and allowing my mother to co-sign, I would tell myself, "" this is going to ruin your life!

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I am requesting that you ( XXXX XXXX @ PNC ) send me something in writing showing where PNC tells the homeowners at the time of making the arrangement for Partial Claim that they could potentially lose their homes in the process due to impediments, lien, lis pendens, or anything of this nature. I don't recall anyone mentioning this to me over the phone when I made the arrangement at the beginning or the end of the arrangement and I don't recall seeing it in writing. Maybe if I had known this at the time, I would have figured something out while going through difficulties during the pandemic. As I stated before, it seems to me that PNC wants the customer to lose their home. Nothing was ever indicated that I could possibly lose my home if I opted to take the moratorium during the initiation of the partial claim process of this loan. PNC made it seem as though I would be able to get back on track once the moratorium ended. It was never indicated or mentioned that foreclosure was an option. A letter was even mailed out stating that I had been approved for the partial claim and then it was retracted. Now you've sent a demand letter dated XX/XX/XXXX the same day I called to make an inquiry and threatening demand and foreclosure of my home loan. However, on this same day at the time, I made the call I was told the home was not in foreclosure and that it was still in review two days later I received the demand letter. This is not the first time I have had issues with PNC keeping with their arrangements and/or agreements. I had to report them several years back regarding another issue during Hurricane Harvey. 

This is also not the first email sent to you ( XXXX XXXX at PNC ). You never responded to the previous email sent out and have taken only one of my calls in which I found flippant and not taking my situation seriously. This is my home. I have been here for going on 19 years and to have someone make light of my situation is appalling. My other attempts to reach you are always redirected to someone else. The one agent XXXX saw the email and sent me to someone in your Loss Mitigation department named XXXX who claimed she didn't see anything there. I have since gone to a PNC location and faxed the first email to you with the email address that is given for you in the email. So, this is proof that PNC did receive the first email. But if you don't receive this one, I have sent it to other entities that may be able to assist me. 

And furthermore, for reference, the HOA also filed the XXXX XXXX during the pandemic. This should attest to something. Everyone knows that people were having difficulty during this time. Why would this XXXX XXXX even be considered especially since it has been determined that there are no liens associated with the property and that there are egregious claims that my attorney has substantiated in her letter along with other documents? 

In the meantime, I have resumed making regular mortgage payments on the loan.",,4998376

Can't repay my loan,"This complaint is against FedLoan servicing. I am in the process of switching from the XXXX program to the REPAYE program and as part of that I was temporarily put in forbearance for the month of XXXX this month. I received no confirmation that the forbearance was processed but I logged into my account at the beginning of this month to check on it and it showed that a minimum forbearance payment of {$5.00} was scheduled to be debited this month. I received a notification today that my application to change my loan repayment plan was denied because the forbearance payment did not process. I found out today that forbearance payments do not autodebit and I was expected to make a manual payment. I never received a notification of an upcoming payment due, a past due notice or anything of the sort between the time of my application submission and XXXX when I received a notice of past due interest payments, which is what prompted me to look again today. 
I spoke with XXXX ( unknown last name - probably does n't have XXXX but he does have an employee number : XXXX ) who refused to give me any information regarding his supervisor. I immediately told him to suspend my debits for this month and to reapply forbearance. I asked him how long it would take for me to hear about the reapplication for forbearance and he replied XXXX4 weeks. This means my account must now become delinquent this month and the brought current after the forbearance goes into effect as payments are due the XXXX of the month. I fear will have an impact on my credit score going forward. In addition, I now have 3 months of interest instead of XXXX which will capitalize upon the finalization of the payment restructuring. 

My complaint is that the process of working with Fedloan is unnecessarily onerous and confusing, so that they set up the process to make it very easy to make a mistake which results in more debt on the consumer. It is clearly in their interest for me to be in forbearance for 3 months rather than XXXX as it makes me beholden to their bottom line for longer and now with more interest for the greedy bastards to capitalize into my principal. They are an engine of financial slavery of sorts as with a servicer like this, it is very difficult to maintain a structured plan to actually rid myself of the albatross around my neck that is my student debt. 
I should have received clear instructions regarding the requirement for a manual repayment. This XXXX referred to specific fine print in the terms and conditions stating the forbearance payments must be made manually, which I have not confirmed yet but will, which is fine, however I deal with the website interface when working with my account, not the terms and conditions, which very clearly showed my forbearance payment was scheduled for autodebit or at least it very much appeared it would be. 
I should have received some notification that my request forbearance was applied. I had to log in myself to find this out. I do n't understand how this is acceptable practice. 

I also unfortunately have very little faith that this complaint will bring anything to bear as they are a behemoth entity and I am but XXXX person - which is evidences by the fact that when I asked for an apology for the deliberately opaque process, XXXX was silent - literally said nothing. He then clammed up further and would only answer very direct questions, which is the kind of callous service I have come to expect from Fedloan.",,2232390
Can't contact lender or servicer,"I received an email from Mountain Summit Financial about me being preapproved for a loan so I contacted them about getting a loan but at first they were trying to charge me way too much interest in the loan but then they agreed to a better price and I was supposed to be paying them two payments of XXXX. The first payment was due on XX/XX/2017 and the second payment was due on X/XX/2017, but today I was going to tell them they can just take the XXXX that is due on X/XX/2017. But, due to my surprise when I typed in their website publications popped up from the Better business Bureau and other government sites saying that Mountain Summit is not licensed to conduct payday loans or collect on them and that they are currently being investigated by the BBB. The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions urges consumers who have gotten payday loans from Mountain Summit Financial to contact the Federal Trade Commission to report identity theft because of the nature of the personal information that has been collected by this unlicensed company. Because according to them that have not right to issue payday loans or collect on them. So today on X/XX/2017 I contacted Mountain Summit Financial to ask them about these allegations and their current investigation and to get clarity on their situation because I currently have a loan with them and I do not know if my information is safe or if this loan is legal. However, they would not answer any of my questions and so I informed them that I would be contacting the BBB and the FTC to figure this out.

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"I ordered from instacart. They offered a pay in four payment option through Klarna.

It does not tell you what this amount is. My order was above this amount. Not a problem if I had known. However, Klarna took 25 % of my purchase total out of my bank knowing they were not going to approve my order. Then it takes up to seven days to put back in my account. The agent said and I quote, the system automatically puts the money on hold just by trying to create the order to confirm that you have enough money for the first payment before the store processes the purchase. So knowing my order was more than they would approve they took 25 % of the purchase cost out of my account for up to a week. This happened today on XX/XX/23. All they had to do was decline the purchase it wasnt a big deal. However now they spend a week earning interest on my money when they knew they were not going to honor the lending agreement.

Dear : XXXX We apologise for the late response as we were upgrading our server which has now been sorted out. We have successfully verified and confirmed that you have refunded the buyer and the funds have been approved to be credited into your account immediately. 

But on the verge of crediting the total pending payment of {$3500.00} USD as we notified you earlier which was paid by the buyer XXXX XXXX. We looked through our Data-Base and found a total pending payment of {$3500.00} USD. There has been another new payment of {$1000.00} USD from the same buyer XXXX XXXX making a double payment from the same buyer. 

We are unable to separate the payments as they have been added to our database and all the funds are pending in your account, as such, we can't proceed to credit your account with your initial pending payment of {$2500.00} USD. 

We are aware of the fact that the new payment of {$1000.00} USD was a mistake on the part of the buyer 's Accountant as he over credited your account. We have then looked into ways of resolving the issue so we can then credit your account with the payment. But as it is now, it has already been recorded in our Data-base and there is no way we can separate these funds. Funds are not returnable to the buyer. In this case, you own the total money. 

We have also tabled the transaction before the Board Of Directors and they have advised that the payment ( s ) still remain "" ON-HOLD/Pending here while you make the refund of the new payment of {$100.00} USD through XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Gift card options after which we shall then credit your account with total payments of {$3500.00} USD Note the buyer 's account has now been suspended. 

So you are allowed to send the refund through the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX pay or Gift card option so that we can credit your account with the total pending of {$3500.00} USD. 

NOTE : Funds deducted from the buyer 's account is not returnable to the buyer 's account. So you are in total control of the funds once we credit it. 

We await your swift response which should include the details of the refund.

Struggling to pay mortgage,": The purpose of the HAF program is to provide struggling mortgage borrowers with assistance to avoid foreclosures. Servicers have had an obligation to notify borrowers of the availability of the HAF program Homeowner Assistance Fund ( HAF ) funds are used to bring account fully current, with no remaining delinquent amounts post loss. Again, HAF Funds are used to bring account fully current, with XXXX DOLLAR remaining delinquent amounts at time of distribution. 
Payments to the mortgage servicer only resume when reinstatement is officially noted and sent as a notice to the borrower ( s ). 
mitigation efforts since XX/XX/XXXX. 
Never notified us of HAF program. 
I live in Maryland and in XX/XX/XXXX a HAF loan was applied for. At every step, Shellpoint reps lied and and failed to follow many rules and guidelines and regulations set out by both the state of maryland the US federal govt.

After repeated failures of Shellpoint reps to respond to state of maryland and after they tried to trick my Mother into a modification without advancing her HAF applcation by their OWN ADMISSION ( seee prior replies by XXXX shellpoint rep to CFPB ) A HAF application was again filed. 
Finally after Shellpoint again played games earlier this year, Senior HAF reps for Maryland finally approved grant and loan for HAF. 
AT no point did Shellpoint reach out during this process. Once the loan is FORMALLY reinstated and noted in an official letter from the servicer ( in this case Shellpoint ), only then does the the borrower resume making regular payments on the debt. 
Again I am completely aware of all payments made and all communications received. Since HAF funds were approved by State of Maryland reps and distributed to Shellpoint mid XXXX, Shellpoint has sent out one communication via postal mail. 
Instead of sending a confirmation reinstatement, instead of offering lower payments as required by HAF guidelines, instead of stating when new payments were start, Shellpoint has the absolute nerve to demand nearly XXXX dollars be paid to avoid foreclosure that they threatened less than 3 weeks after they received nearly XXXX worth of HAF funds. 
Before we hire a lawyer who is a specialist in dealing with Shellpoint antics, we are presenting the situation here in the hopes that they make things simple on themselves. 
We demand that Shellpoint notes the payment of nearly XXXX in HAF funds, an official reinstatement letter, and also request a list of ALL payments made and covered by HAF funds, and when the new payment amount starts. 
As the payments were on hold until HAF funds were approved and released mid XXXX, it's is quite shocking for shellpoint to dare demand nearly XXXX and threaten foreclosure less than 3 weeks after receiving HAF funds. 
So far we have noted that Shellpoint has violated. 
The entire XXXX family is a military family and Shellpoint 's mistreatment falls under violation of SCRA. "" While military families enjoy the same legal protections and privileges afforded to all other homeowners and tenants, they also have additional housing protections under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act ( SCRA ), which is enforceable by the Justice Department and servicemembers themselves. '' https : //www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-cfpb-put-landlords-and-mortgage-servicers-notice-about-servicemembers They also clearly violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 ( CFPA ) Further according to FAQ presented by state of maryland for HAF funds : If notified by DHCD that the borrower qualified for HAF funds, the servicer : o Accepts HAF funds as reinstatement, sends borrower a letter stating that reinstatement is underway or now completed, lists the time frame for payments restarting, and/or o Evaluates the borrower for loss mitigation based on the availability of those funds, and if the borrower qualified for loss mitigation under the servicers normal guidelines, offered the borrower any loss mitigation option for which the borrower qualified. 

Shellpoint again has not done any of the above and instead tried to once against trick my Mother, an elderly military widow, into sending in payments that were not overdue or owing since the mortgage was ubject to the HAF loan process and put on hold.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"Complaint against FedLoan Servicing, at Pensilvania Higher Education Assistance Agency XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX Attention : SECRETARY OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION My complain is about the incorrect information/count of only 2 payments toward my eligible payments for my Public Service Loan Forgiveness program after I consolidated my Federal Students Loans under the Limited PSLF Waiver rules. 
1 ) On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from the FedLoan Servicing, which is a part of the Pensilvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ( PHEAA ), a federal student loan contractor with the U.S. Department of Education. 
2 ) In the FedLoan Servicing letter of XX/XX/XXXX, FedLoan Servicing blatantly erased all my 97 previously recognized eligible payments toward my Public Service Forgiveness program. FedLoan Servicing wrote to me that my newly consolidated loans ( # 12 and # 13 ) have only 2 eligible payments toward the PSLF program, and FedLoan Serving posted a new date for forgiveness as year XXXX. In other words, FedLoan Serving extended my 97 previously found eligible payments with another 120 payments or 10 more years. This is unacceptable and against all rules of the Limited Public Loan Forgiveness waiver. 
3 ) Needless to say, I consolidated my student loans on XX/XX/XXXX under the Limited PSLF Waiver rules. 
4 ) Just before consolidation, my student loans had 97 eligible payment toward the PSLF program as I am a public teacher. The same 97 eligible payments were counted in the previous years by FedLoan Servicing at PHEAA. I should be forgiven my student loans at about XX/XX/XXXX. I continue to work as a public teacher. 
5 ) I consolidated my student loans because the U.S. Department of Education stated If you have Federal Family Education Loan ( FFEL ) Program loans, Federal Perkins Loans, or other types of federal student loans that are not Direct Loans ( for example, those from older loan programs, such as Federally Insured Student Loans [ FISL ] or National Defense Student Loans [ NDSL ] ), you must consolidate those loans into the Direct Loan program by XXXX XXXX, XXXX ''. I was also advised by FedLoan Servicing Associate over the phone to consolidate my student loans. 
6 ) According to "" https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/pslf-limited-waiver '', if you have a Direct Loan and have already submitted an ECF or PSLF form, If you took out only Direct Loans or previously consolidated other federal loans into a Direct Loan, and youve previously submitted an ECF or PSLF form, you may automatically receive credit for prior periods of repayment. Automatic credit will be granted only if the employer listed on your form was determined to be a qualifying employer. My employer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is determined to be a qualified employer. All my previous employers were determined by the FedLoan Servicing to be eligible employers as I have been certifying every year at FedLoan Servicing, PHEAA. 
7 ) FedLoan Servicing is cutting off PSLF participants and not counting the eligible payments, even though FedLoan Servicing has evidently sent me letters every year stating my PSLF eligibility and counting my eligible payments every year around XXXX. 
8 ) FelLoan Servicing are DISHONEST federal student loans contractor. The U.S. Department of Education promised that "" XXXX has determined that it can use flexibilities provided by the HEROES Act of XXXX, which allows the Secretary of Education to waive certain rules related to the federal student aid programs during periods of national emergency. '' 9 ) The U.S. Department of Education also posted "" Why do I have to consolidate my loans or file a PSLF form by XXXX XXXX, XXXX? There is a limited time that this opportunity can be offered, as it is tied to special flexibilities that have arisen due to the COVID-19 national emergency. At this time, that emergency flexibility has been determined to last through XXXX XXXX, XXXX '' XXXX ) Therefore, FedLoan Serving is conducting the opposite illegal actions, nulling the previous eligible payments toward the PSLF program, after the new Consolidation of student loans, and disregarding the Limited PSLF WAIVER. '' FedLoan Serving is deceiving the students with newly consolidated student loans and not providing the deserved eligible payment counts toward the Limited Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.",,5312860

Opening an account,"Coupon for {$2000.00} cash clearly shows the terms are set at XXXX maintaining balance for 90 days. thats not disputed. 

Whats disputed is the private client banker named XXXX XXXX at the sunset branch in XXXX XXXX told me differently. He vehemently argued against me and my understanding of the coupon needing to maintain a XXXX balance for 90 days. He completely convinvced me the coupon was at XXXX balance due to the Chase changing the rules. He went on to tell me he has multiple clients that already received the XXXX payout for coupon on the balances of XXXX not XXXX. He reasoned its due to the coupon is to get new money and more people signed up for the chase private client services. 

He was very convincing but I only had his word and a coupon that read differently. So that is when I asked if he could put something in writing as i had already moved funds to another account that wasnt in my best interest and wanted to move the funds quickly over but first needed this written confirmation. During the course of our 20 minute exchange i told XXXX that he better be sure of the information he is providing me as i would hold him accountable and to honor it ifanything was different. He laughed it off and said I know what i am talking about and cited how long he has been working etc. 

Since that last phone call. XXXX has ignored repeated phone calls for two weeks straight. Finally on the third week I spoke with his female manager. Who instead of being concerned about the lack of returned calls just took information about other incidents that were not her branch. I told her the details of my exchange with XXXX and she said she would reach out to the coupon dept to see if they could do an override. She explained the coupon terms again which were not what XXXX had stated but said she would try and honor what XXXX stated by contacting the coupon dept. To this date i have never received a phone call from anyone at that branch. 

They are playing cover up. I filed a complaint with the XXXX  about the issue. The executive level office has taken over 2 months dragging their feet with this case. They transferred it to another staff with no explanation or notice provided. When I would call to find out whats going on they stated "" research '' I spoke with XXXX first who was handling the case. She relieved me when she said "" IF XXXX SAID Those claims THEN WE HAVE TO HONOR THE COUPON '' she advised me the executive level has FULL AUTHORITY to make exception to the coupon rules etc. I was relieved becauase I knew very well what tj told me about the coupon and convincingly so. I also knew at this point that XXXX was wrong and the reasons he was not calling me back was it would have been a very difficult conversation for him to have admitting he was completely wrong and I was right and that he is now not going to honor the coupon. 

He ducked out and whats worse is the executive level is rubber stamping this behaviour and believe his side of the story. During my call with XXXX i found out and asked if the branch calls are recorded. She told me they were not. i still had hope that they would believe me as its just reasonable to do so at this point. 

The executive level now called me today to deny the coupon but said they have some more research to do. The executive level did nothing to help me at all. They were not my advocate. I reported they didnt call me back for many many calls for two weeks when i was simply trying to sign the document and come in and move funds. Everyhting was set to go and last minute tj stopped all communication with me. 

The executive level XXXX is the assigned agent now this is the research. she calls XXXX  branch or emails XXXX  branch mentions me calling multiple times and not getting a call back. The branch states "" we were with clients when he called ''. XXXX ( my advocate ) says "" OH OK, well that wraps up my investigation then. 

I have offered to provide cell phone records showing the phone call i had with XXXX and the phone calls after our initial communication proving i am telling the truth. Chase executive level is not interested in this at all. 
It is disgusting XXXX employees have zero accountability. and things like this can fall down to he said she said and believing the one side who has less proof than the other Only one of us stopped returning multiple phone calls and never called me back at the end of their business day. Only one side is not calling the other side back to this very day. 

Its disgusting the exectuive level can white wash this and make me wait around for months only to deny the coupon. This executive level stated if XXXX made those claims then we MUST HONOR THE COUPON. 
This was misleading as they didnt in the end They are not doing the moral right thing here. A business deal was made over the phone with XXXX. He is lying his way out of it like I knew he would. Just because the phone calls at the branch are not recorded or monitored does not mean i should have to face the consequences of that., I moved funds based on his false information. It is clear even to XXXX that it "" looks like XXXX found out differently and is avoiding the communication '' This group of people at the executive level have zero honor.",,4046742

Late fee,"I am a trans* person who had a credit card with BofA. My BofA checking/savings ( c/s ) acccount had overdraft protection on it, linked to this card. I had my name and gender legally changed prior to a move in early 2014 and I closed my BofA ( c/s ) account shortly after moving to the new address. I then zeroed out my credit card ( cc ) by paying it down in XXXX lump sum, then cut it up. I opened another c/s account at a credit union before closing my BofA c/s account. 
A few months later, I get a forwarded letter from my old address from the BofA cc account and it has accrued late charges totaling something like XXXX dollars. I called them to ask what the charges were for and they would not speak to me because I told them my legal name, despite telling them that I have a legal document that would prove my identity. Not only that, the c/s account was grandfathered and referred to me by a nickname, not my birth name, so there was yet another name in the mix. I then tried the website to see if I could bring up the account, but did not ever set up online account access with them and could not now do so without falsifying information. 
I wrote a message from within the website help and they told me that I would have to call. I called again, only to be told that I am not the account holder, so I may not access the account. Two years later, I can not open a bank account now, thanks to this outstanding debt. I called BofA again last week and they told me that it is out of their hands because they already sold the debt to a collection agency and settlement is not possible, even though they are now willing to admit that I am the original account holder. 
I do n't believe that this debt is justified in the first place, since it is, according to BofA, stemming from an overdraft protection service charge. That 's what? {$10.00} - XXXX a month? And they informed me that the debt sold was over {$600.00}. 
I believe that BofA should allow me to settle for the original debt of {$10.00} - XXXX as my original creditor and waive the insane fees they tacked on. I tried to close everything properly, but perhaps should have closed the account before changing my name. The hard part is that I would n't have been able to open a new account until the name and gender change process was complete and I would have been without direct deposit, checks, debit, PayPal, and credit until I had my official papers in-hand. Even so, my paperwork from my grandfathered account from the BofA in Texas, that has a nickname instead of my then-legal name, would have made the process difficult, as it would have required someone who is American* or knows about American nicknames to think.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"To whom it may concern, I purchased an investment property XX/XX/XXXX with M & T Bank being the lender. The intent to purchase the property was for rental income purposes. The other was to help a former business partner with housing as well as her credit profile by putting her on the mortgage loan and grant deed for 1 %. Putting M***** M**** on the loan would help improve her credit. M***** M**** increased credit score resulted in higher credit amounts to help pay for the catering business XXXX XXXX we owned together. I was the only person injecting cash into the catering business. 

Out of my pocket and no funds from the tenant, I provided the property down payment, paid for the unit remodels, repairs, maintenance, and property management. I have all documented proof. 

4 years later, the tenant XXXX XXXX with a leasehold and 1 % interest informed the contracted property management, that she will not be able to make her rent due to Covid -19 hardship. 

XXXX of XXXX, I placed the property into forbearance as I could not make the payments without the tenants participation in rent. I also suffered from income loss due to my inability to work as the pandemic hit every part of the real estate industry. The State of California would not allow the collection of rents if the tenant claimed Covid Hardships. 

From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, I tried XXXX times to get the property out of forbearance by executing a modification of the loan. The loan modification was not executed due to the tenant with a leasehold and 1 % interest refusing to sign the loan modification documents three different times. M & T bank will not proceed with a Covid 19 loan modification without XXXX XXXX signature. 

After XXXX XXXX claimed to suffer Covid 19 hardship, she refused to sign the loan modification documents. This is due to a lawsuit complaint she filed claiming entitlement to 50 % of the property???

M & T bank will not proceed with a Covid 19 loan modification without XXXX XXXX signature. 

After pleading my case to M & T Bank, HUD partners, My Attorneys, no one is able to help the situation? I am being punished with a foreclosure, current horrible credit, future income loss, and inability to sale the property, for helping house that tenant, with a leasehold interest and 1 % ownership interest, build a catering business. 

Under the advise of XXXX XXXX Attorneys, that are on a contingency payment agreement, XXXX XXXX is willing to risk a foreclosure on her credit profile to try and have me capitulate to her demand of an unwarranted, unsolicited, unfavorable, ownership interest of 50 % in the property.

Can't repay my loan,"I have had the unfortunate experience of dealing with Simm Associates, a collection agency, in handling my student loans. After losing my one of my jobs in XX/XX/XXXX and working at my other job only 30 hours/week ( employer given hours ) I was not able to make full payments on my student loans. I offered to make reduced payments, however, the original lender, XXXX XXXX, refused a payment reduction to $ XXXX/month vs the required $ XXXX/month. They then sent my loans to SImm Associates. Since XXXX 2016, I have received multiple calls to my business cell phone which I have asked them nicely on MULTIPLE accounts to not call. I then began taking screen shots of the calls so I could document the continued calls. The next step was calling me during the business day at my place of employment. I asked that call to stop as well, but they continued. They even went as far as to call my father-in-law harassing him for information- again, I asked them to stop and they did not. Each of these callers from Simm Associates were rude and threatening, telling me they were going to put a lien on my assets, garnish my wages, continues to call my work office until a solution could be reached.

Struggling to repay your loan,"I do not have the dates off hand because it happened over 2 years ago, but after reading the following forbes article, I can definitely state that I was a victim of at least 4 of the 6 common complaints that were being made about Navient. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 1. created obstacles to repayment by providing bad information ; - Almost every 2-3 months for over at least 2 years, I was provided applications to submit for income-driven repayment plans that I would fill out and re-submit and A ) was told they never received and B ) was told was the wrong form. Each call ended up in a forbearance with interest accrued. The total cost of my loan has gone up dramatically since. Needless, to say it was an endless cycle of torment.
2. processed payments incorrectly ; - Upon finally agreeing to begin making the monthly payments, I was given on three different occasions 3 different addresses to send the payments to, which subsequently caused a return of payment to my bank, and delay in paying off actual student loan. This took over 3 months to get resolved.
- failed to act when borrowers complained ; - I asked on dozens of occasions to receive my payment or any correspondence via post-office mail and not e-mail as it was not reliable for ensuring that I was receiving my applications for refinancing / monthly payment adjustments / statements, and until today, have not received a single letter via standard post office mail.
- illegally cheated many struggling borrowers out of their rights to lower payments, which caused them to overpay for their student loans ; - My original federal student loan amounted to only XXXX and I had under 3 % interest and it was highly recommended that I consolidate everything and go to a private vendor to simplify everything ... .I now have an interest rate of 6.5 % on my student loan with a monthly payment of over {$1300.00} now and a total loan of over 100k.

Problem when making payments,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made an ACH payment of {$830.00} to my MasterCard with Bank of America. I received email confirmation of the payment on XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America.This was for a payment due in advance of the statement due date for previous month 's entire balance. 

Subsequently, the XX/XX/XXXX payment was added back to my card balance on the statement date of approximately XX/XX/XXXX because it did not get made by BoA. I called BoA on XX/XX/XXXX and questioned why the credit card payment did not go through and if there was a problem with the routing and checking account number. I confirmed both, then their phone banker confirmed the failed payment was due to a system update Bo did that impacted ( cancelled/nullfied ) the timely payment I made and that it was due to factors that were not in my control ( i.e.BoA system update ). They then charged me a late charge on my account due to this, then did not notify me that the payment failed to be applied due to their system update issue. She then told me she would refund the late fee to my account, then I requested the same ACH payment be made with the phone banker, to which she input it to be made to my account. Their system update not only cancelled my timely payment, it resulted in an unnecessary late charge, and my account showing past due. The banker confirmed none of it was my fault. 

Number 1 ), if a customer makes a credit card payment through BoA 's automated system and due to THEIR system updates the payments get rejected, they should PROMPTLY notify the impacted customer 's that their scheduled payments did not apply to their accounts so the customer can either be aware that it was BoA 's fault their system update effectively voided their prompt phone payment or 2 ) reenter the same payment already made by customer so it's applied timely so the customer does not get charged a late fee! The phone banker told me it was not due to factors within my control and that they would reverse the late payment fee, but still this is misleading. I only noticed the ACH payment I made timely through their automated system did not go through when I reviewed my next statement and saw the late fee and previous payment applied back to my balance. This is not the customer 's fault, I made the original payment timely. 

Why does not BoA have internal controls in place to identify ACH payments in process that failed due to their system updates/upgrades so they can promptly notify the customer of the need to re-input their payment and to avoid charging them late fees on their statements? I made every good faith effort to pay it on time, the failure was on BoA 's end which is why the phone banker offered to reverse my late fee. Not to mention, the cost of my valuable time having to call BoA, wait 15 minutes to talk to a human being, then press them on why the payment they confirmed on XX/XX/XXXX via email was added back to my account statement on XX/XX/XXXX and inquire why I was charged a late fee when I made my payment timely on XX/XX/XXXX, my time is money!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3504286

Struggling to repay your loan,"To whom it may concern, Currently, I have eleven student loans. Two student loans are with Navient Corporation and are up to date. Nine are with the Department of Education and are in default status. More than three years ago my wife and I decided to consolidate our individual student loans. We both contacted Navient by phone and set up consolidation plans. All her loans were consolidated by Navient. Unknown to me, all eleven of my loans were not consolidated. Navient only took two of the loans, so the other nine sat at the Department of Education without my knowledge. I was under the impression from Navient that all eleven had been consolidated back in XXXX. 
We filed our XXXX taxes in XX/XX/XXXX. We were to receive a refund. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from the IRS stating that they had seized, treasury offset, my tax refund because I had student loans in default. I immediately called the Department of Education and I was forwarded to their collection company, Consumer Research. I found out, by phone and online that nine of my student loans were in default since XXXX, with a principle balance of approximately {$44000.00}. Added onto the principle balance an {$8000.00} service fee by Consumer research. A total of around {$52000.00} was due. 
Over the last three years, I was under the impression that I was either paying monthly payments on my student loans or when employment was part time, Navient suggested that I either defer or do a forbearance due to economic hardship. The remaining student loans at the Department of Education sat for more than three years went into default and there was no attempt to communicate that information to me by mail, email, or phone by the Department of Education for the past three years. 
When I spoke to a representative from Consumer Research, I was certified and then told that I have three options to settle my defaulted student loans. None of which I could afford, so I have been currently working with a company called XXXX XXXX to attempt to get my student loans out of default. 
The Navient Corporation is currently being sued by five plus states including Washington, who have alleged improper actions on behalf of student loan borrowers. I have recently contacted the Washington State Attorney Generals office and filed a complaint against Navient.

Delinquent account,"I received a letter from Synchrony Bank telling me that they reviewed my account and due to XXXX returned payments, they were closing my account to further purchases. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I scheduled a payment not realizing that it was scheduled to be debited from a checking account that is closed. When it returned, I called Customer Service to find out and they told me. I asked them if there was a way to remove the checking account from my profile and the representative told me no there was n't. So, that checking account will remain under my profile until I pay the card off. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I scheduled a payment to be debited on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I got my direct deposit on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and made XXXX payments to other creditors and I had planned to make a deposit into the account by the XXXX on the XXXX. I was n't worried about the Walmart payment because it should n't process until after midnight on the XXXX and the funds would be deducted a business day or XXXX later. Well, that is not what happened. I checked my back account later that day to find out that Synchrony tried to process the payment that morning, well before the processing would normally occur. I was charged a non-sufficient fund fee with my bank, which they credited back to me as a courtesy because they were confused how the servicer could do that. My bank was not sure if the Synchrony would attempt to debit the account twice for the Walmart payment. So, I used my bank 's bill pay service and sent a replacement payment by XXXX XXXX. I never got another message from Synchrony or Walmart about my payment being returned for the second time, so I figured everything was good. 
Now, almost a month later, I received the closed account letter and I called Synchrony. She told me that due to the XXXX NSF 's the system automatically closed the account. She said that the XXXX XXXX return was due to a closed account and that in XXXX XXXX, I had a payment return on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX due to NSF 's. I told her I did n't know anything about the XXXX on the XXXX and I sent a replacement payment of {$54.00}. She put me on hold and came back a couple minutes later advising that she tried everything, but she could not reopen my account. I have been with them since XXXX and I am highly upset by this. I feel that the early processing of the XXXX XXXX payment should not have occurred. I was involved in a car accident on XXXX XXXX and as soon as I was able to, I went online and scheduled the payment to send through my bank trying to make the returned payment from XXXX XXXX right. I do n't handle my accounts in this fashion. This is not typical of me. I would like this issue to be reviewed by upper management.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2330289
Struggling to pay mortgage,"I was told by PHH Mortgage at the Beginning of XXXX that I could get a 3 month forbearance plan and the payments would be put at the end of my mortgage and then in XXXX to start making my regular payments, it turns out that when I call them on XXXX XXXX, 2022 to make my payment, my relationship manager said that I owe XXXX, then he said that he would try to work it out, to wait until he calls me back on XXXX XXXX, he call back and said that he couldn't help, but would sent it to a commit to see what they can do for me.

Can't repay my loan,"I have a significant amount of student loan debt. Over the past few years I would call Navient for assistance regarding my account, how to effectively pay down debt, while at the same time still have money for all other necessities, bills, and various monthly payments. I am a XXXX, and combined my husband and I make a decent salary. Navient would come back with an exorbitant amount to pay. I would express there is no way we can afford $ XXXX a month and they would respond urging a deferment or forbearance, without discussing any other options or possibilities.

My husband and I work hard, and strive to maintain excellent credit. Navient is now affecting my credit rating.

Managing the loan or lease,"In XXXX XXXX, I borrowed {$3500.00} from OneMain Financial, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, SC XXXX. I was told the monthly payments would be {$300.00} per month until the bill is paid off, and I was given a check for the {$3500.00}. When I received the loan papers in the mail, I read that the term was XXXX years, and I realized that by the time I finished paying off this bill, I would have paid {$22000.00} during the XXXX years. Soon after several months of paying XXXX per month, I increased my payments to XXXX in trying to get the bill down. But at the end of XXXX I noticed that for each payment, the bill was still not going down. I would pay {$350.00} instead of {$300.00} and they would turn around and charge me all of the {$350.00} for interest. I spoke to a representative, who told me that all I was paying was interest because the loan was compounded daily ( this made no sense to me ). I soon realized that I would never get the bill paid off. On XXXX different occasions, I found that I was not able to make my monthly payments and I called OneMain to see what I could do. They told me on both occasions that I could re-finance the loan and then I could skip the current month 's payment. This happened twice, until the principal amount that I owed became over {$8000.00}. I was not told this would happen, and I did not understand how this happened. 

I am attaching XXXX payment statements that I could find, that shows where I making over-payments on this loan, and they were charging me interest in the exact amount of my overpayments ( {$350.00} ) See attachment. 

As a result watching of an infomercial, I contacted a company called XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX has been sued by you for unlawful business practices, and I feel that I was further taken advantage of by this company in this unlawful practice. They just changed their name from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX, XXXX and continued to solicit money from me. They advertised that they could help you consolidate your bills and get a fresh start. They said they would contact your creditors and negotiate your debt and get it down, and negotiate debt settlement with your creditors. In hope that this company could help me get this bill paid, I signed on with this company to pay them {$260.00} a month, beginning XXXX XXXX, and they would settle this bill that the interest would not allow me to pay. I paid this amount through automatic bank draft from XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX. 

In XXXX XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX, XXXX. vaguely stating that the company ( infomercial company ) that I was dealing with was not XXXX XXXX, that XXXX XXXX had gone bankrupt, and that I was to continue business as usual with them. The letter was so vague that I was left not knowing who "" they '' are, referring to "" your attorney. "" I also received a letter in the same month from the Estate of XXXX XXXX, indicating that XXXX XXXX had been sued for illegal activity and forced to quit business. The letter said that I "" have the right to get back any money that is with your attorney in a settlement account. '' I have paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX every month for XXXX months, and I would like to get back all of this money that I am entitled to. Then they said that there is {$00.00} money in my settlement account. Yet, I was notified over XXXX months ago that the account with XXXX was settled. I do n't know what happened to the XXXX payments for XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX in the amounts of {$260.00} each. And my XXXX question is, if the courts ordered this company to cease doing business because of fraudulent activity in XXXX, XXXX, why are they still drafting money from me up until XXXX XXXX, XXXX? 

I feel that I have been taken advantage of and wronged by both XXXX XXXX ( or XXXX ) and One Main Financial, I am asking you investigate my claim against One Main Financial on my behalf.

Closing an account,"This complaint is in response to US Bank perpetuating XXXX harassment, fraud, and extreme carelessness that resulted in the closure of my business bank account. They closed my bank account on XXXX XXXX, 2020 without my knowledge or permission, causing extreme financial duress for my new business. On XXXX XXXX, 2020, I began my interview with US Bank to open my business bank account. The interview was via XXXX with XXXX XXXX. He told me that he was going to walk me through the entire application process in the XXXX interview. He did so, and during the process, told me not to add the punctuation in the name of my XXXX, even though that's how it's listed on my Articles of Incorporation ; this careless advice lead to my application being in "" pending review, '' which is where all of the problems started. After the XXXX meeting, XXXX XXXX then started sending flirtatious emails to me, which can very easily be found in his work emails, and on his work phone. I also have copies. He then also texted me using the information provided on my application asking if I would like to go out on a date with him the next day. When his advances led nowhere is when the real problems began, as my bank account was then mysteriously closed the very next day. When I inquired with the personal banker XXXX had set me up with, XXXX XXXX, she would not return my calls. It took me calling and texting her for 7 whole days before I finally told her that I would be including her in my complaint, which immediately sparked her interest in replying. She told me that she didn't know what happened or why my bank account was closed, but, when pressed, said it had something to do with people somewhere in a back office. Very vague, very suspicious answer. I was referred to contact XXXX XXXX, the branch XXXX, who also never called me back, or responded to my emails. I have called the helpline at least half a dozen times now, and it is obvious to me that the people at US Bank all have something to hide, and they are covering up for a XXXX harasser.

Problem when making payments,"I enrolled in Autopay for my Amazon Store Card on XX/XX/2021. In the email sent to me by the company confirming the enrollment, Amazon.com Store Card Services said : "" Payments will be deducted from your XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX account ending in XXXX on your payment due date. Continue to make regular payments until you receive confirmation in your billing statement that the Autopay program has been established. '' I received no such confirmation. No billing statement was issued. My billing statements are issued on the XXXX or XXXX of each month. 

On the payment due date, XX/XX/2021, I searched the Amazon.com store card site to verify that no payments were pending. The site indicated no pending payments. Therefore, as directed by Amazon.com Store Card Services, on the payment due date I made a regular payment in the amount of {$300.00} ( the same amount as the requested automatic payments. ) The payment posted successfully and was withdrawn from my bank account on XX/XX/2021. 

I woke up on XX/XX/2021 to find that the Amazon.com Store Card processed another payment via Autopay for {$300.00}. I'd had no email confirming this payment and there was nothing on the Amazon.com Store Card site indicating that this payment was scheduled. While the Amazon.com Store Card site indicates that both payments posted on XX/XX/2021, my bank account indicates that the payment I made manually on XX/XX/2021 was successfully processed on XX/XX/2021 and the payment made via Autopay was received for processing XX/XX/2021. 

As a result of this, my checking account was put in overdraft. The overdraft generated a {$35.00} fee from my bank. I'm also left in a very precarious financial position as I have a strict budget. 

I contacted Amazon.com via live chat and the agent, XXXX XXXX, was very apologetic, but ultimately completely unhelpful. The only recourse I was offered was to have a check for a refund of the overpayment mailed to my home address which would take approximately 15 days. 

I am very upset because the processing of this Autopay payment was in direct contradiction to the email I received confirming my enrollment in Autopay. That email is attached as a screenshot.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,4879627

Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"I had an unsecured personal loan with Citizens Bank that I had gotten when I was in their employ. A few years went by and I no longer worked for them and the loan was paid off. 

I thought everything was great and I still had a decent image of the company, so my fiance and I decided to open a joint checking account there. Then a few months after having the account, my debit card stops working on a Friday afternoon, which was odd because I had gotten paid that day and there was ( should have been ) a few hundred dollars in the account. 

I log into my online banking to see that {$280.00} or {$380.00} ( it's been a few months ) debited from my account and all it says is "" dda memo ''. I know from working for them for over 5 years that this means that the bank itself has taken money for something you owe ( an account sent to collections ). Which I'm not aware of anything that I may owe, because I had paid off the previous loan and had received no correspondence in the last 2 years since I had banked with them that anything was outstanding. Also, nothing had been reported to a credit bureau. 

Best part is, they did this right before closing on a Friday night, so I'm frantically making calls to find out what's going on, only to be told that all the departments I need to talk to are closed and don't reopen until Monday morning. I spend all weekend with no money and not being able to pay the bills that money was to go to. 

Monday morning I finally get to talk to someone after being transferred a handful of times to find out that apparently my loan had been paid off, but for some "" glitch '' the system never recognized the payment and the system decided I owed that money and just pulled it from the deposit account that I had with them. Basically an "" oops, sorry, the computer messed up ''. They offered to fix the issue, however the refund of my money could take up to 48 hours to be refunded to my account. So, they can take money instantaneously but make you wait to put it back. 

I ended up getting my refund, but then about a month later I got a letter in the mail showing the amount and letting me know that the loan, which I thought had been paid off years before and had been reported to the credit bureaus as closed, was now paid and closed.

Fees or interest,"In XXXX, I applied for and received a Citibank XXXX XXXX credit card. When I received it, I found out it required a {$450.00} annual fee, due immediately. I destroyed the card and called Citibank on XX/XX/20 to cancel the card. I spoke to a representative who convinced me to keep the card and she would waive the fee for the first year. They sent me a new card. I then received a bill from Citibank for {$450.00} and called them back. Another customer service representative told me that the first person was wrong and that there was no way to waive the fee. So, again, I told them I wanted to cancel. He asked me several times if I was sure and then told me to destroy my new card and that the account was closed. 

After that, I received one bill for {$450.00} and thought this was billing made before my cancellation. Yesterday, I received another bill and called Citibank. This time I was told that 37 days had passed since my first bill and therefore there was no way to avoid the {$450.00} fee. The representative now said she was successful in canceling my card, but I would still have to pay the fee. Of course, I was very angry, but the woman told me there was nothing I could do. 

Now I have no card and owe them {$450.00}. I will be sending them a certified letter tomorrow to escalate the dispute as suggested by the FTC.

I called BoA to fix the error on Monday XXXX XXXX, 2015 and I was told by the BoA representative that BoA would charge me interest for 7-10 business days after which time they would retract the interest from my next bill and apply my payment. 

I pay my bill in full every month and have had this card for 25 years. My payments that day ( I made XXXX cash payments to the same account ), if properly applied, would be for the full billing amount - no interest would be paid to BoA. I am unhappy that BoA misapplied my payment even though my payment coupon was printed for the proper account and that they are charging my account interest that they otherwise would not be able to ( by misapplying my payment to another account they prevented me from paying off said account in full ). Their solution to allow the interest to accrue and then take it off my next statement is unacceptable. By delaying the transfer of my payment to the proper account for 7-10 business days they hurt my credit and fraudulently charge me interest that they are not entitled to. 

When I asked the representative for a reference number for this transaction ( moving the payment to the proper account ) I was informed that BoA offers no such reference. I asked her for her name so I could have some verification that I discovered and reported to BoA the error in applying my payment and she would only give her initials. By refusing to provide me with verification for my request to fix BoA 's error, and only providing me with the initials of the representative after I pressed her for some type of verification, BoA gives the appearance of trying to set up the customer to suffer further errors ( BoA can always say they never got my call to fix their error, for instance ) in order to charge consumers more interest fraudulently.

If the law allows them to continue to post this adverse statement on our credit report, even with this settlement, then at least, they can include a more clear statement in the Status section, such as, "" Account settled on XXXX XXXX, 2013.

Managing the loan or lease,"I have XXXX car loans with the same lender. They have erroneously posted payments to the wrong account, which resulted in the other loan becoming behind by two months or more. The company then began repo activity to repossess the car. I contacted the company and attempted to resolve the issue, they were uncooperative and rude. They refused to correct their error and credit the payments to the correct account. They demanded payment immediately or would repossess the car. I asked for a supervisor but was told that none was available and they would not do anything about the issue anyway. They claimed that payments were not made on several occasions and that late fees had accrued resulting in both loans being behind by {$1000.00} each ( more than XXXX months ). I had contacted the company previously in XXXX 2015 and made a payment to bring the account current, because they had posted payments to the wrong account and refused to correct the error. In XXXX 2015 the company claimed that the loan was {$1000.00} behind, even though it was current the month before, stating that late fees and other penalties had caused the amount to be so much. I could not get anyone to explain the creative accounting method which they are apparently using. The XXXX loan had XXXX or more payments credited to it, that were made to the other loan, in addition to the correct payments that were made to the XXXX loan. The XXXX loan was paid XXXX months in advance at this point, however the company claims that the loan is {$1000.00} behind, due to late fees and penalties, and that the payments that were in excess of the payment due were not credited as future payments, but applied to the principle. Thus having no effect on reducing the monthly payment amount nor being available to credit the overage to the XXXX loan which was behind by several payments because they had made an error. They first said they could not apply the erroneous payments back to the correct account for the reason that they had been applied to the principle instead of a future credit, then later in the conversation they claimed they could not correct the payment error because the XXXX loan was also behind by {$1000.00} due to missed payments in XXXX and XXXX 2015. The missed payments were the result of not clearing the bank, however the payments were sent within a few days of the event, to keep the loan current, and the loan payments were never more than two weeks late. I could not get any explanation of how they had calculated a past due amount of over {$1000.00}, nearly XXXX payments, when the loan had never been behind more than a couple weeks. They claimed it was "" likely '' due to late fees and that I should pay my bills on time to prevent this from happening. I advised them that I had the payment history in front of me and that their information was incorrect, because the payment history showed payments every month, with a second payment made whenever a payment had not processed as well as several months with the payment for the XXXX loan posted to the XXXX loan incorrectly. The loan payment for the XXXX loan is withdrawn automatically from my checking account. The payment for the XXXX loan is made manually online through XXXX XXXX and requires the account number to be entered. I have only made payments to the XXXX loan by this method thus I have never entered the account number for the XXXX loan, which would indicate that the error is in there payment processing method and not with my payment method. 
I spoke with several reps but they all repeated the same prompt, they demanded payment immediately or would have the car repossessed, I offered to make a payment the next day when my pension payment would be available because I did not have the money available until then, they refused any compromise.

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ohio XXXX Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX.

ARS goes so far as to admit in their response that they have reasonable grounds to believe that their information is verifiable even though Bankruptcy Rule 9037 prevents the public from viewing the B21-Statement of social Security. They merely assume that because identifying information matches, that is enough to verify a public record. In XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) the court stated : XXXX XXXX argues that it did not violate a duty to reinvestigate because it had no duty, as a matter of law, to go beyond the Judgement Docket in conducting its reinvestigation. We disagree. A credit reporting agency that has been notified of potentially inaccurate information in a consumers credit report is in a very different position than one who has no such notice. As we indicated earlier, a credit reporting agency may initially rely on public court documents, because to require otherwise would be burdensome and inefficient. However, such exclusive reliance may not be justified once the credit reporting agency receives notice that the consumer disputes information contained in his credit report. When a credit reporting agency receives such notice, it can target its resources in a more efficient manner and conduct a more thorough investigation.

The credit reporting agencys duty will also depend on the cost of verifying the accuracy of the source versus the possible harm inaccurately reported information may cause the consumer. 

Additionally, Please be advised that the use of XXXX  is an unreliable source as their own disclaimer states, The provider does not represent or warrant that this site or its content will be error-free Provider disclaims all responsibility for any loss, injury, claim, liability, or damage of any kind in any way related to ( A ) any errors in or omissions from this web site and the content Futhermore, the fact that ARS cites pending case law, that has not been fully adjudicated ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX. XXXX ), is a clear attempt to mislead me into thinking this case holds some precedent. Upon speaking to the Deputy Clerk for Judge XXXX and asking the status of this pending case, I was told it is not even close to being completed as they are still determining the scope of class and a Motion to Dismiss has been filed. 

Im sure you are aware that Lawyers alleged dishonesty in their practices exposes them to potential liability to third parties as well. For example, if a lawyer knowingly and substantially assists or encourages a clients wrongdoing ( ARS ), those who are harmed by the clients misconduct may sue the lawyer in court for allegedly aiding and abetting the clients misdeeds.

I am well aware that ARS has broken several consumer protection laws both on the federal and state level. They have damaged my credit, preventing me from obtaining credit, loans, financing, etc. because they continue to verify and report a bankruptcy on my credit file that they have not, can not, and will not, provide me with their method of verification showing there is not one iota of a chance that they are reporting this information in error.

Assuming information matches is NOT protecting a consumer from the possible harm inaccurately reported information may cause the consumer.

Be aware that I am making a final goodwill attempt to have you clear up this matter. The listed item is entirely inaccurate, incomplete, and represents a very serious erroring your reporting. Failure to respond satisfactorily within 30 days of receipt of this certified letter may result in a small claims action against your company.

I believe it is an UDAAP violation to wait 9 days ( XXXX ) after charging me a late fee until notifying me that I missed a payment. The fact that they let an extra 9 days of interest accrue before alerting me of the missed payment and then refused to waive the interest is particularly galling.",,4668928

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"Hi, I was contacted last year by XXXX XXXX XXXX, formally XXXX XXXX XXXX, about a student loan I was unaware that I had. They provided me a loan payment book with coupons that I was to send in every month with a check. The book also included a website where I could register to pay my loan off online. I paid the first installment via check on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This check was cashed. 

I then tried to register on XXXX, but was unable to because my SSN was not registered with their system. Fine, I thought, they have my wrong SSN, but they were still able to cash my checks, so I'll just pay them this way. I continued to pay them monthly using the coupon book. 

However, I became increasingly frustrated in XX/XX/XXXX when I tried to contact them via phone in order to resolve the SSN issue. I wanted access to my account. I wanted to see what I owed and why, and what type of loan it was. I had NO information and NO access.

I couldn't speak with anyone though because either my SSN or my account number were required to move forward with the call. As I mentioned, my SSN didn't work, and it turns out that my account number wasn't registering with them either. This made no sense to me because my account number is printed on every single coupon I have. Further, I found it suspicious that they are able to cash my check every month with an incorrect SSN and an incorrect account number. I tried to contact them via email, but was unable to because I needed my account number for that as well.

Lastly, today I logged onto National Student Loan Data System and saw that while I could account for the 8 subsidized and unsubsidized loans and the 1 I pay through heartland, I could not find a 10th loan, which is what this loan is. I am paying off 10 loans, but can only find evidence of 9. My credit report also does not show that I owe XXXX anything. 

I don't know what this loan is and I have no way of finding any information out because this company has made it literally impossible for me to contact them. And yet, they have no problem cashing my checks.",,2958756

Billing disputes,"On XXXX/XXXX/2016, I purchased a XXXX XXXX Desktop Hard Drive from XXXX.

I called XXXX customer service and was assured they would send me a return label and I would get a replacement unit. XXXX NEVER mailed me such label, or a replacement unit, or issued a refund for {$84.00} ( price of unit and shipping ). I then contacted my Credit Card XXXX, DISCOVER, and filed a billing dispute XXXX, Case No. XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received correspondence from DISCOVER CARD, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT XXXX, saying they were closing the dispute as "" the transaction appears to be valid! "". Furious, I called DISCOVER CARD at their toll free number XXXX, and attempted to have their customer service reps address a number of issues. The first call got me thru "" XXXX '' / '' XXXX '' who was flip, condescending and refused to put me through a GENUINE SUPERVISOR who could address the issue. He finally hung up on me while he had me wait for such a supervisor. I called back at the same number, and also got their Ohio Call Center once more, only this time I spoke with a "" XXXX '' who made believe he could not hear me and finally hung up on me.

I 'm a XXXX year old XXXX XXXX Veteran living on a fixed income and {$84.00} for a XXXX LB PAPERWEIGHT which I was expecting to use as a Hard Drive in my desk top computer may seem trivial and petty to both XXXX and DISCOVER CARD, but for me it represents SUBSTANTIAL LOSS for something I 'll never be able to use as intended. I would like DISCOVER CARD to use their CORPORATE MUSCLE and force BESTBUY to send me a replacement WORKING UNIT, and a return label with which to return the defective unit, OR issue a CHARGEBACK to XXXX for selling non-working electronic parts and refusing to stand behind them through either replacement or credit for price paid.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"Received forbearance on mortgage payments due to XXXX. Nationstar, mortgage servicer for XXXX, offered loan modification at end of forbearance I complete all 3 trial payments. Nationstar sent me loan modification documents to sign and return. 

However, the modification attempts to capitalize {$3200.00} for monies Nationstar did NOT pay on my behalf during the forbearance period. After speaking with Nationstar reps, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, ( XXXX ( no longer with company ) and XXXX  ), the first one told me this was for money Nationstar "" anticipates paying on behalf in the future for taxes and insurance, and that although it'll be capitalized into principal balance now, Nationstar will still collect this amount a second time through increased escrow payments ( essentially I would pay twice, once through having this money added to loan balance and then again through increased escrow payments ). The second time I spoke with Nationstar, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, the rep agreed with me that the only money Nationstar paid out on my behalf during the forebearance was {$190.00} ( this agrees with my records ) and the rep could not explain the additional {$3200.00} being added to the loan balance as a condition for modification. Rep said she would call me back that day. She never did. When I called Nationstar again, I was put in touch with Nationstar 's Executive Resolution Office, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) who informed me would get to the bottom of this attempt to capitalize imaginary money. She told to NOT sign the modification and also to NOT make any additional payments until the loan modification anomaly or question was resolved. I have not heard back from XXXX though I have left messages 3 times since XX/XX/XXXX. 
This period of not knowing the status of my loan modification, what Nationstar 's intentions are and whether or not I should proceed with trying to sell the home in order to pay off the mortgage is causing me distress. 
Nationstar 's summary of their terms for the modification states ""... unpaid interest, real estate taxes, insurance premiums, and certain assessments paid on your behalf to a third party, will be added to your mortgage loan balance. '' Since Nationstar services millions of mortgages, many on behalf of XXXX for XXXX such as myself, and many people are receiving loan modification offers, it makes one wonder if Nationstar 's attempt to capitalize ineligible money is just a one time mistake in my case, or is there a system in place where Nationstar routinely adds ineligible fees or payments never made on behalf of borrows to the loan balance.

XXXX also said if still not working, they would expedite a physical cardOn XX/XX/XXXX, I had to call again because I still received nothing. I talked to another supervisor, XXXX. She said to she would n't send a physical card and needed to try a different email address. I gave a different email, and was told that I should receive in XXXX hours. By the way, all my email IDs are working fine receiving all legit emails, including those emails from Amex on other business. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had to call again, I talked to agent XXXX, and he told me that XXXX hours waiting was not enough, needed to wait for XXXX hours then call backOn XX/XX/XXXX, I called again. Another agent XXXX told me they could not issue a physical card.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called again. Got to connect to the supervisor XXXX, he did n't seem to remember anything about this and he was still asking me if I preferred ecard or physical card, and I had to explain the ecard not working and the whole history. Then he checked with their Concerns department. After I was put on hold for XXXX minutes, he still insisted they could only do an ecard, and what to do the same thing as they did and failed for XXXX times already, even wanted to ask me for yet another email address. I then told him that he was just trying to get me dealt with without resolving the issue and I would definitely make the whole experiences known to others if they didb't resolve it in a satisfactory way. Then he put me on hold and then told me he would escalate me to the Concern department to issue a physical card. When I questioned him what about the outcome of last time they sent my case to the Concerns department, he just dodged my question and put me on hold again. Then came back and told me that he saw the last escalation to Concerns department, but they had not responded, and he just re-escalated again. He also confirmed my mailing address again where the card should be sent. He asked me to wait for XXXX business days to receive the physical card. 

It has since been a month, and I never received any physical or ecard, no one at American Express attempted to contact me at all. I have no way to access my remaining balance on my egift card.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXXI refinanced my home to make some home improvements and pay off some bills. At that time houses in California were at the top of their market and mine appraised for more than it ever had, and more than it has ever since. I was approved to take a large amount of cash out. I had a good job and thought it was a great thing. For several years I was struggling to make the {$1900.00} payments. In XX/XX/XXXXmy doctor took me off work for medical reasons, I had a savings so I continued to make the payments but called XXXX XXXX continuously throughout XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to keep them up to date as to what was going on, and that soon I would not be able to keep up these payments. At the end of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX told me I needed to be behind on payments 3 months before they could help me. I let my payments fall behind so I could get help before it was too late, and in XX/XX/XXXX I started the modification process. In XX/XX/XXXX, my father XXXX XXXX and I moved my mother in with me to take care of her. She suffers from advanced XXXX and needed full time care. Taking care of her was a full time job and more. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally offered a modification by XXXX XXXX and I took it, I paid {$9000.00} in back payments and XXXX XXXX ONLY lowered my monthly payment by {$100.00}. I was shocked! I went back to XXXX XXXX and told them that this reduction was not enough for me to be able to keep up my payments and they told me it was too late as the paperwork was filed, then they stated that I could reapply for a new modification all over again if I needed another reduction. Which, I did. I knew this was going to be a huge struggle. The run around started all over again. Sending paperwork, them losing paperwork, me re-sending paperwork, just a constant back and forth. In XX/XX/XXXXI heard about Keep Your Home California and decided to ask for help. During the next 5 years to present date, I have applied to Keep Your Home California and XXXX XXXX at least 5 times to gain approval of one of their programs to help me keep my home, only to continuously send paperwork, them lose paperwork, round and round again. Reps would tell me what they needed from me to get a modification, I would send it to them, over and over, only to get turned down each time by XXXX XXXX for some other document they needed or was missing ( which I was never contacted for additional documents prior to denial ) Complete run around. Every couple months XXXX XXXX would request more information and give more reasons why it was taking so long. They would get my hopes up by telling me that was a good sign. In the meantime, my home had suffered a great loss in value, as all had, in the years since XX/XX/XXXX. I have spent hundreds of hours on phone calls, gathering documents, writing hardship letters, faxing paperwork, and sending emails to save my home. To no avail. They kept telling me not to send payments in order to get the modification approved. After all the run-around XXXX XXXX has put me through, the heartache and lost hope, my home went in to the foreclosure process, and now has an auction date of XX/XX/XXXX. As many times as I have tried, and tried, and tried, and have been denied, I have never given up because I truly believe there is a program to help me, I just havent found it yet. I have written many letters and each time I told my story, I went into great detail of how I lived my life, what I was losing, and how devastated I was. This time I will just say, I have had a true hardship, and am at the end of that hardship, so if I am given the chance to keep my home, it would be such a blessing! My last denial from XXXX XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX for my income was too low and my income has increased since then. I am paid a fair wage, I just dont have the full time hours yet, but I have been given more hours at work, and will work into full time in the next year, I have two tenants who pay rent, and I am a XXXX for a friend of the family. Keep Your Home California denied me because I filed an application with them too many days after my Default on the home was filed. All these requirements that everyone has, I dont find out until all the paperwork has been turned in, and many days have gone by. There are so many hardships in the past years on my part why I have not paid for so long, but why did XXXX XXXX let my account sit for so long when they knew I desperately needed help? I asked them for help long before I could not pay, because I saw it coming. Then to send an insulting NOI stating they have tried to contact me without success and I have never been in contact with them to get my financials. Plain insult. My house is a 35 year old modular sitting on a permanent foundation with XXXX acres, but in the county I live in, I estimate the value at {$170000.00} to {$200000.00} My income was reduced drastically over the last 6 years, that is why I contacted my bank for help, and one of the reasons I have fallen behind on my payments, and, the reason I have applied so many times for help. I also believe the value of the home is also in question. The appraisal in which this loan was based was back in XX/XX/XXXX and has reduced since then. Home value in this area has reduced tremendously in the last 10 years. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX, during the application approval process, that there would be an appraisal of the home. They never came to appraise the home or gave me a report. I believe the appraisal never happened because of the reduced home values in my area. Not really sure because every time I call XXXX XXXX I get a different rep or different answer.. What I am looking for is relief from the high mortgage payment and to place the past due amount to the back of my loan, if that is possible. I am willing to pay my debt and keep the loan, I am only asking for a reduction in the payment or loan amount to make an affordable payment. I have spent the last 30 years here and would love to spend my next 30 years here as well. I am asking for a chance, a chance to keep my home, a chance to stay in the area my children grew up in and still reside as adults, a chance to be near my mom who is still suffering from XXXX and is in a local XXXX XXXX, a chance to keep my job that is in this area. All of this will not be possible if I lose my home, as this is a small rural community and good rentals, and good jobs are hard to come by. I will have to move away from everything I have built here in the 30 years I have lived here. Please, if there is any way we can work together to make this happen, I would sincerely appreciate any help you can offer. My house is scheduled for auction sale on XX/XX/XXXX. PLEASE HELP, I JUST LEARNED ABOUT YOU YESTERDAY. I also learned my Trustee was sued by the state of Washington for inappropriate foreclosure procedures. I need HELP. I feel XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

We received a payment of {$200.00} on XX/XX/2018 and a credit from XXXX for {$69.00} on XX/XX/2018. Since the full payment of {$420.00} was not received by the due date of XX/XX/2018 and interest charge on {$50.00} was charged on XX/XX/2018 which is the closing date for your statement. 

To calculate your balance subject to the interest rate, we start with any balance carried over from the previous day and add new charges or fees then subtract new payments or credits. This gives us the daily balance for one day.

Next, we add together the daily balances for all days in the billing period and divide this total by the number of days in the period. This gives the balance subject to the interest rate for the billing period. 

We appreciate your business and thank you for being a Chase customer. 

Thank you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ''",,3018601
Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"I took out a loan with Solo Funds in XXXX of 2021. I was having some financial issues during the holidays related to a move.

I asked that my account not be charged. The company received my request and acknowledged it but said that they couldn't/would n't stop charging my account.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","I am receiving letters from Wells Fargo stating that I have to raise my flood insurance coverage and has forced place coverage on my current property.

In addition to the Wells is stating all my insurances must match, which my insurance agent has stated is false according to the according to NC law, they must be with XXXX % of each other which they currently are. Wells Fargo is trying to force place coverage on my property when it is not required on XXXX parts. One they do not have replace cost estimator from my insurance company. The issue according to my Insurance agent is the my policy is currently withing XXXX % of all my other policies which is within NC law. No one can confirm where they are coming up with the replacement cost coverage other than they must match. The only thing I have seen on file is appraisal which is under the required amount and my insurance agent has emailed me the replacement cost estimator. My problem with all of this is that the investor on the loan is XXXX XXXX which Wells is servicing the loan for and now we are told this is Wells Fargo 's rule not the investor. Frustrating that a bank is making up the rules when it should be insurance company and the state that is providing the coverage. In my opinion Wells should have asked a replacement cost estimator from the current Insurer instead of assuming coverage is not adequate. I am sure if we look closely that the additional charge for the additional insurance cost is a benefit to Wells Fargo in some financial way.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2140672

Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,"On  XXXX   XXXX ,  2017  I noticed a collection for {$200.00} had been added to my credit reports. On  XXXX   XXXX  I called each credit bureau and disputed the collection. Just 8 days later on  XXXX   XXXX  I received notice via email by Equifax that the investigation was completed.

Equifax did n't provide this information, instead restarting the investigation. Again about 5-7days later saying the debt was "" verified ''. I called again and asked for a supervisor and as ked again for documentation to verify how my debt was determined . Again nothing. I then sent a certified letter request verification, which under the FCRA Section 611 ( a ) ( 7 )   should be provided to me within 15 days of requesting which was n't and instead AGAIN instead of providing this information, they again restarted an investigation. Since then, both  XXXX  and   XXXX   have removed this debt from my reports, yet still it remains on Equifax. I also have contacted the original creditor which provided me with a statement. As you can see on the attachments, neither my address nor does the account number match that of which is being reported, which by law means it should be removed from my credit reports, which only Equifax fails to do.

Struggling to repay your loan,"My Student Loans are mostly managed through Navient but also through  XXXX  I live in  XXXX  but am a US citizen. For almost a decade now I have been repaying my  XXXX  student loans and my law school student loans. I have two types complaints the first is general regarding both Navient and  XXXX . The second is specific to Navient.      1 )  The options for repaying student loans from a foreign country are MISERABLE. While I understand that loan repayments must be made in  US d ollars, this leaves me with the option of mailing checks or money orders in  US .  This is not a problem save for the expense of mailing  XXXX  checks to  XXXX  different places ( about {$6.00} extra a month ). My real concern is that these companies continue to tell me they prepare invoices and mail them 20 days before they are due. There is no way to change that except through registering for e-notices. I do not want to go this route but my bills often come days after they are due. I live in  XXXX  outside  XXXX  so it is not like it should take that much longer to reach me.      2 )  Navient : I am sure you get tons of complaints about navient 's services. Their automated telephone receptionist is beyond unhelpful. As i said, I live in  XXXX  so there are always problems with my questions, e.g. payments. I can not reach a live person on the weekends ( i tried 4 times on  XXXX   XXXX  only to be disconnected when i asked to speak with a representative ). I called regarding a loan payment that bounced because of a banking issue. That was corrected and  Navient  told me the payment had gone through on Friday. I wanted to make sure after speaking iwth my bank on  XXXX   XXXX  and could n't reach anyone. I then called on  XXXX   XXXX ,   XXXX   at   XXXX   XXXX   to make sure again that the payment was fine. IT was not and I had a past due amount. When i attempted to make the payment over the phone I was informed they no longer took CC which is insane and the only way I could make payments in the past over the phone as i have no US bank account. They then took my debit card information and told me it went through but that I should check back. Again, that is insane. They charged me interest on the past due despite my efforts to make the payment and ensure things were corrected. Then I was told that they would charge me interest until my loan check arrived by mail if the debit card did not go through. This is unacceptable. I have made considerable efforts to ensure that I pay my loans on time including getting a US $ checking account at my  XXXX  bank. I am responsible for late fees despite getting invoices after they are due and while my check is in the mail to them ( an extra 7 days ) I have no options to make payments directly. Rather than make it easy to make loan payments and keep them current, Navient has reduced my "" emergency '' options when a problem rarely occurs. I can not correct the problem and have to rely on smail mail at my cost and with interest while it works its way to Navient.",,2470134

My complaint is that one of the representatives asked me if I knew how to alter a document like in photoshop and I got the impression he wanted me to alter the documents put balances in so he could issue me a loan I do believe altering a financial document to obtain a loan is considered fraud and illegal And that fact that on XX/XX/XXXX my bank balance meant the entire world to them and I just refused to alter a document.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"I finished XXXX XXXX in XXXX and had Stafford loans which I consolidated probably at the end of XXXX or beginning of XXXX, so these are older loans, so I'm not sure if they are considered Federal loans anymore because I consolidated them, but they were stafford loans originally. I consolidated to lock in a 2.87 % interest rate. I began making payments, and at some point the loan service was changed to ACS Education Services. My due date was changed to the XXXX of every month. So I made electronic payments that they would get on the XXXX every month, but it took them between 5-10 business days to recognize the payments, so they considered them late. I would get phone calls typically by the XXXX of the next month, saying XXXX payment is late, and that they would contact credit bureaus if I didn't make my payment. This started probably around XXXX. The next day typically I would get an email confirming I had made the payment, but they apparently would consider the day they confirmed my payment as the date of payment. I had contacted the Virginia Attorney General 's office about this, but since I wasn't being charged late payments, and this wasn't going to affect my credit, I didn't pursue the matter, and i just started making the XXXX my payment date. However on XX/XX/XXXX, I found out from my current servicer, XXXX, that I was disqualified from a 1 % loan interest deduction which was a benefit I was elligible for, if i made 48 on time payments ( XXXX shows I was disqualified in XXXX, while ACS or Conduent ( conduent is what ACS changed its name to ) ).

I did some research on ACS and there were lots of complaints, so much so that the Department of Education made most of ACS ' loans transferred to other servicers. I lost out on saving a lot of money, would have been thousands, because they were incompetent and didn't process my payments in a timely manner. Is there anything I can do? XXXX only has the information ACS provided, which just shows I made late payments, but it doesn't show my complaints to ACS. I can supply emails showing my complaints to ACS, complaining about how long it took them to process my payments. I've also found my email to the virginia attorney general office.

Problem when making payments,"I have two credit card accounts. I have had them for several years and represent in total a credit line of {$30000.00}. I have used their auto bill pay services for these accounts. 

As of XX/XX/2022, Barclays issued a automatic payment on one account of more than {$8000.00}. The normal reoccurring payments for this account were just a few hundred dollars. I contacted Barclays immediately by phone ( within 24 hours ) before the payment was processed ; I receive notifications in advance by email. They would not correct their error and reverse the payment. 

I contacted my bank before they had processed the payment to have return the remittance advice. Allowing the payment to process would have started a waterfall of overdrafts and fees. The said they had to allow the payment to process but would reverse it expeditiously. Which the did. 

Barclays subsequently canceled my autopay on all accounts; including the unaffected credit account. I discovered this in XXXX when my supposedly auto payment was processed. I incurred a late fee and a negative credit report. 

I then contacted them several times ( seven ) by phone. They acknowledged the problem. I attempted to make significant payments {$10000.00} total but Barclays had blocked my bank account and could not find a way to unblock ( supposedly ). The payment on my other account came due and it went past due. This was three weeks after I contacted before several times.

The duration from the point of their initial failure to currently is two months. I have elected to make payments from restricted accounts of which incur fees.

The subsequent statements show that there were no additional purchases on the account. Also on p.2 it states it determined dispute to be "" a valid charge. '' The was the only notice I received from Citi Cards that the disputed charge was upheld. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. The first charge of a late fee. Since at that time all purchases had been paid and the annual fee refunded, the late fee was for non-payment of the disputed {$99.00} that was reversed the previous month. 
-Citi Cards XXXX Statement for XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. Citi Cards reversed its previous reversal and provided a credit for the disputed {$99.00}. It did not reverse the previous month 's late fee for nonpayment of the disputed {$99.00}.

The interest rates are really high ( XXXX % and XXXX % ) which makes even interest only payments impossible to repay along with my 2 direct consolidated federal loans ( current balances of {$74000.00} and {$91000.00} ). Together, the payments on all of these loans totals {$1200.00} per month. I make {$2500.00} gross/ {$2200.00} net biweekly. I am the sole source of income for our family of three. I was unemployed from XXXX 2016 through XXXX 2016, although I worked odd jobs, XXXX and XXXX to try to cover our expenses. We ended up qualifying for XXXX for a period of time because my income was so sporadic and unpredictable. I finally found a job in XXXX 2016, but as a result of my increased income, we are ineligible for XXXX and unable to afford insurance for my whole family with the plan offered by my employer. While my employer covers half of the employee health insurance premium, the payment for my portion of this policy alone is {$340.00}. Electing this coverage for my son and husband would leave us paying health insurance premiums of nearly {$1600.00} per month. Of course, this is a good health insurance policy without ridiculous deductibles that would bankrupt us. But even if we decide to pass up the group plan for my husband and son, this leaves us with the option of paying around {$700.00} per month for a XXXX plan with a {$14.00} deductible. This would still leave us paying a little over {$1000.00} for health insurance. I feel horrible about not being able to afford this coverage for my family. After all, I know how important health insurance can be when something unexpected happens. My son was born at XXXX. My little boy survived and has done remarkably well after a rough start. Our hospital bills for my two week XXXX and his 3 month stay in the XXXX were just over {$740000.00}. Because our family was covered by my previous employer 's health insurance, our deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses ended up being around {$600000.00}. Now I am in a position of trying to decide between paying my family 's living expenses ( our rent alone is {$2100.00} ), including a hefty health insurance payment, or making my minimum monthly student loan payments. It seems like there is no good option, especially with my private Navient loans. I have provided them with copies of my paycheck stubs, bank account statements and ridiculous amounts of documentation yet they refuse to work with me to put me on a financial hardship program because I do n't have a definite figure for my health insurance coverage yet. Instead, they continue to threaten to sue me and tell me to make these {$200.00} payments to keep the loan out of default. I have made these payments, but I do n't know how they are applying them or why they choose these arbitrary amounts.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I 'm filing a complaint against Chase @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CO XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. @ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX, for wrongfully and illegally foreclosing and selling of my property @ XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Both were given a copy via certified mail, of a Land Patent that has been brought in my name, and therefore they do n't have the legal authority to sell my property. A Land Patent is the  only form of proof of absolute title to land/property in the United States of America. Since neither has title to my property, how can they foreclose or sell the property? Also, in the case of foreclosure by a bank, the law is on the books today which says that any debts, which lie against the land, that existed prior to the land patent being issued, are removed from the land. There still may be a debt owed, but my house/property is off limits, lawfully. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I requested from chase the original wet ink signature copies of the Promissory Note and Mortgage/Deed of Trust in order to prove that Chase has the legal authority to foreclose on said property. I 'm challenging the debt that Chase claims I owe. I have demanded proof of standing to collect or foreclose and of the debt owed to Chase. To this date, I have not received any requested documentation of proof from Chase and therefore demand that Chase and their attorney immediately stop the sell of my property on XXXX XXXX of XXXX. 

I also challenge that I may not have received an actual loan, since the bank 's account was never debited, and my account was never credited, makes the loaning of credit only unlawful. All monies and interest that repay the mortgage are pure profit to the bank. Plus with the fact that the Promissory Note that I signed was sold without my permission, my mortgage debt to them is actually paid in full with that note. Therefore, non-disclosure by the banks, created by the bank of these important facts can be legal grounds to have my mortgage taken off the books and forgiven.",,2767341

PayPal is acting very irresponsibly in this case accusing me of committing this crime when they allowed someone to hack into my account. They would not even speak with me. They asked for no evidence, no police report. Their Trust and Security team simply made a decision based on my log in.

I did n't even think to tell him that the State of Texas statue of limitations on debt is 4 years, which this would be past then for sure.

I was advised by an attorney to send a "" Validation '' Letter to them to validate the debt under the FDCPA and FCRA. Under the law, they had 30 days after receiving the validation letter to respond to my letter and validate the debt that they're reporting to the credit bureaus. It has now been over 70 days ( they had 30 days under the law ) and they have NOT sent ANY kind of validation of this erroneous account, for both my husband and myself. Please note that before sending the validation letter to this company, I also sent a dispute letter to all 3 credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), and my husband did too, and AUDIT AND ADJUSTMENT has NOT removed these account from our credit reports, or have sent us any kind of validation. I request for this company to remove these accounts from my credit reports immediately, as well as my husband, as they have not followed the law, have reported inaccurate information on our credit reports, which carries a {$1000.00} fine, as well as FDCPA Section 809 ( b ), which carries a {$1000.00} fine for not validating the debt and still continuing to report it on my credit reports. Thank you for helping me resolve this matter.",,3148126
Dealing with my lender or servicer,"Good afternoon, I have a loan with Navient- it started as a loan with XXXX . XX/XX/XXXX I took out just over {$26000.00} to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX college. Since that date, when I have paid back just over {$23000.00} combined between interest and principal. As of today I owe just over $ XXXX so even if I were to be able to pay it off completely today it would amount to {$39000.00} in interest on top of principal. I have XXXX loans combining this amount, XXXX with a 5.25 % interest rate which was my first loan that has a cosigner. The second has a 9.25 % interest rate, both variable- yet they have never varied. I tried communication through their "" e-mail us '' option as I was tired of the XXXX red-tape. I was even told by one phone conversation that never in the employees time has he seen XXXX lower an interest rate. E-mailing through their website proved to be just as useless. I decided to look at their annual report to see where I could find the names of Board of Directors and an address of a corporate office. I found such an address and stated in one of my on-line e-mail conversations that I would be sending letters there, in which they replied that it was not an official address of Navient. So I was lied to. My true desire is to renegotiate the amount I owe as I can not come to terms paying well over 100 % of the principal on a non tangible good. From that communication I insisted I be called be somebody in their corporate office, this too proved to be fruitless as the woman basically explained it was my fault the loan had reached such a high amount. As well as the school should of better explained it to me, when I was XXXX apparently. I had noted that from reading their annual reports that they reported XXXX in dividends for the year XXXX and how it was fair that I must pay {$450.00} dollars a month while they apparently have so much money they can pay XXXX in dividends as well as a CEO taking in over XXXX a year in salary- in which her reply was "" that is just political ''. 
- Most recently I field for a co-signer release as I now make nearly $ XXXX a year, although after deductions of over $ XXXX and my {$450.00} a month to Navient- it is not an impressive salary. I filled out the release form in which one of the requirements was to provide proof of income- in their denial letter that had XXXX rejection reasons, not providing proof of income was one of them. I e-mailed them asking how that could be a reason and where my pay stub that contains sensitive information went too. They also require me to provide proof of graduation, this I never officially did due to the fact of the overwhelming debt burden I had to go to work full time and then some. I just bought a $ XXXX home myself and they are telling me they ca n't release a co-signer. 
- I also find some of their practices to be fraudulent. For many months as i logged into the website it showed my account had a XXXX due balance, although my statements proved otherwise. I was a business student so I knew to continue to pay the statement amount or face credit disaster or apparently aggressive debt collection that my state of Connecticut is suing against. When I questioned them on this matter they stated that my account never showed the XXXX due balance and just like that it was back to normal- after my notification. In hind sight I probably should of come here first. Although I took screenshots of the XXXX due balance and copies of my e-mail correspondence although those could be subpoenaed if it escalated to that point. 
By no means am I trying to get out of paying a debt, I expressed this to them and wish to settle- I asked to do so. So I emailed and they gave me a phone number to call stating I could use that to settle, upon calling that number ( all in e-mail backup of this ) - they stated they do not settle loans. But I stated, you sent me an e-mail stating you do.",,2316522

I asked them to fix the issue and reimbursement the late fees bit they would n't so I told them I would stop paying them. now, I am unable to view my account history in full to prove my case ( account history stops at XX/XX/XXXX ).

When i initially signed up in 2017 i was told after the contract that my Loan was forgiven. I want out of my contract with everyone i do not need to pay anyone a service fee monthly for 21 months just so they can do a annual recertification 1 time a year. Not to mention the man i spoke to in account services was extremely rude he cut me off every chance he got. His response when i told him that it would of been cheaper for me to pay off my actual loan was thats right, but thats how this contract works.

Struggling to repay your loan,"I talked to navient maybe a months ago about not being able to keep up with the $XXXX  payments becuse my income is barely XXXX  months. When I talk to the person in charge of my account at that time they explain to me to go ahead and call back and they would work something out when I could make payments again. They did not say that my account would possibly be sent to litigation and again I explained my financial hardships that I just couldn't afford to do it at that time. Since then I got a call about a good-paying job I start towards the end of XXXX and I called navient last Wednesday and spoke to a man by the name of XXXX. He explained to me because I hadn't made the payments in a month and said that it was breach of contract that it was now going to be sent to litigation, but that I could set up three monthly payments of $XXXX  and come XXXX  work out a way to get back in the payment program. I called him today to make $XXXX payment and he added as I was talking to him that even though I'm squeezing what money I can to do $XXXX  payment this month's one in XXXX and one in XXXX  and then he said we would revisit doing a payment plan, because my accounts is in a discharge status. He went on to tell me even though that I'm making these payments to show good faith and paying my loans that my account could still be sent out to litigation so again this is the second time I've tried to work with navient and I cannot get anywhere I've had a lot of financial hardship and they tell me one thing when I call one time and then the next time I call they go well this might not do anything. I have XXXX  and the way that they have treated me over the years and especially previous to this they were always degrading and would not let me talk and interrupting me. I've told them over and over again my financial status what I can afford and they were never willing to meet me halfway or say will take what you have because at least you're trying to pay. I do not understand how navient can do this to people when they are willing to pay what they can afford my income is very limited and this is not stress that I need considering I have a XXXX. I hope in reaching out the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau again that there could be a stop to this because my hands are tied financially and I have to be able to pay bills and eat. I'm concerned that if I make these other payments that may still get sent to litigation in which case they will ask for I believe up to $XXXX at once and there is no way I can afford to do that. I hope again the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can help me in this situation because there's absolutely no reasoning with these people on top of the fact I have record of excessive phone calls up to four times a day for a month month-and-a-half which I'll gladly provide. Most of my conversation with customer service at navient has been degrading me greatly saying I had x amount of years to pay this off but not understanding that people have Financial hardships I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. They will also tell me one thing and then say something else when I call back so I'm never getting a straight answer. I need the help of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help in putting me into a payment that I can afford that allows me to pay off my student loans otherwise I'm never going to be able to pay this off. If it was up to me I would have never taken loans but I'm from a single parent family very low income and I did what I have to do to get my education so that I can better myself. When I told them that I would have to reach out and file a complaint with some sort of Protection Service, they said that it's a breach of contract and it nobody could do anything about it and it's very frustrating to try and work with people that are unwilling to work with you regardless of this or any situation I'm willing to do what I can but I can only do what I can afford I got to eat and pay other bills too. Even the payments that they offered me before we're still more than what I was paying originally it just makes no sense they want money but they don't want to work with anybody to come up with a way that they can get something from people regardless of how old the loan is.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"I was given advice by the lender in consolidating my loans. This advice impacted me in a negative way. First, the interest that I had accrued by that point was automatically capitalized making the student loan compounding. Secondly, the interest rate was simply averaged out over the loans. I could have paid higher interest loans off earlier helping me get out from under the debt. I know more now, but I was misled by the loan servicer through the consolidation process. I was never told by the account rep during our conversation that the interest would be capitalized. 

Date and actions On XX/XX/2015 the total of {$19000.00} was capitalized and I began paying interest on that amount. This was due to consolidation. That was an amount already interest with zero benefit to me as a debtor ( other than having a single payment vs multiple ).

Late fee,"Barclaycard must have initiated a change in their fee waiver policy/strategy that no longer treats customers fairly. They have firmed their stance that regardless of loyalty to brand, credit worthiness or payment history, they will not waive fees that are not a bank error. This stance is unfair and disparate treatment ; if I were stop paying my monthly payments and allow my account to fall delinquent, I would be rewarded by various payment programs that would reduce my interest, zero it out all together OR, waive fees. IF your stance is to only waive fees in the instance of a bank error, then this stance should spread across all lines of credit whether I am a customer for 10 years and never went late, or a customer who is 100 days late. To further exacerbate the change in policy, the customer service agents are ill equipped to deal with the push back customers who have faithfully honored their terms and agreement are more than entitled to give. In the past, instances of oversight or in my case, Tropical Storm XXXX taking out my power, our requests have been reviewed levelly against our payment history and previous fee reversals. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I called to request a courtesy reversal of a fee that posted to my account at midnight on the date of my payment due date. I explained to the representative that I was unable to schedule my payment on the website or even by phone because I had no power. There were many news bulletins, warnings for my area and expressed power outages in my area. My payment was scheduled at XXXX the very next day when I saw that power was restored. My payment was technically XXXX hours late. Despite my explanation and the absence of previous fees, I was treated rudely, placed on extensive holds and ultimately hung up on by the agent. This behavior is unacceptable and unfair to customers who have no idea that a change in policy has been implemented. If this is the way Barclays intends to proceed they need representatives who can better communicate this to customers who deserve the benefit of the doubt ; especially when customers who do not honor their terms and agreement are given leeway that contradicts what I was told on XXXX XXXX, 2015.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1597842

American Express considers the account new for the first 30 days ( Consumer Savings Deposit Agreement XXXX XXXX rev ) I am most certainly in my rights to request having my spouse added as a joint owner the same day the account is considered opened ( American Express Agreement ).

I was Transferred for the last time to a person impersonating XXXX XXXX from Wells Fargo fraud department at a local branch here in XXXX and was provided a picture of his business card and NMLS ID. I talked to this person for a hour and he explained to me how he needed to file a FTC report and report the higher up department of wells Fargo, this conversation was full of many details and procedures about Wells Fargo and the FTC that all sounded legitimate and even provided pictures of my FTC report and of my well Fargo FTC checking account that I was told I would need to transfer my money to, so that my money would be protected by the FTC. I Proceeded to call off of work due to what I was being told as I was worried that my bank account would be wiped out as he told me that my account had thousands of dollars in pending charges that would go through by XXXX and was told that all my information such as my social security and banking info was under risk. I went to my local bank and took all of my money out in cash and put it in this coin hub ATM as I was told from XXXX XXXX he stayed on the line the whole time through this transaction. This did seem a little odd to me, but I did not think much into it as I thought I was talking to Well Fargo the whole time since I called the number off the back of the card and XXXX XXXX was very quick to answer any question I had quickly and thoroughly and was very reassuring that my money would be protected and was very polite and seemed sincere about the whole situation and was quick to tell me every policy and procedure of Wells Fargo without hesitation. I withdrew XXXX from my account and I proceeded to deposit all of my XXXX $ into this coin hub ATM as directed all while still on the phone with XXXX XXXX. I proceeded to make an account and put all of my money in the coin hub account and was sent confirmation emails of the transaction and a QR code. XXXX then told me I would have access to this account in two hours and to check up with him if I needed anything else. I called after two hours to the same number that I had been transferred through Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX and asked for XXXX XXXX and immediately the call dropped and I tried to call again and the phone line had been discontented. After this I Proceeded to tell my mother what happened and I called the Wells Fargo number XXXX off of her phone as I feared my phone may have been hacked. I talked to a customer service representative who then transferred me to the fraud department and I told them what was going on and they transferred me to someone higher up as they said this case of fraud needed to be taken to a higher department. I then talked to this net agency fraud department representative who proceeded to give me a claim number for my fraud case through Wells Fargo. The next day I called off work and went to the bank where XXXX XXXX said he worked from his business card and gave the Branch manager my claim number and was told that they could not find this claim number in any department and that the call may have been fraudulent as well. I proceeded to file a real claim in person with the branch manager and called local authorities. Two Incidents where I called this XXXX Wells Fargo number, one from my phone and one from my mothers phone and on both calls not being able to talk to real representatives of the bank and being led on by fraudsters. Every time I called this Wells Fargo number it went through the authorization, holding music, and phone dial direction and on both phone calls I was transferred 2-3 times after speaking to a customer service representative.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,7119459

Fraud or scam,"paid lexingtonlaw firm for XXXX telling me they would help build my credit and every month i paid on the second of each month on time and now that I'm looking over my bank statement they somehow charged my payment on a different day each month for almost two years and when i cancelled they told me i had 60 days for a cool down and when i cancelled on the website it said 57 days and then i reported them fraudulent and that when i got and date of XX/XX/XXXX and when i cancelled i noticed that street lights were changing faster every time i came up to the light and it would just as i stopped at the light or even faster if their were no cars around. If the police was around my car they would stop controlling the street lights and my car giving it full power which made it hard to stop. 
i also bought a car thinking i had good credit but it wasn't even my credit and when i damaged my vehicle i had it go the shop and they somehow put oem parts on my car and the XXXX dealership swapped out unnecessary parts of my car too even if it wasn't damaged and almost took my doors too which would have unnecessary considering he took my exhaust and rear bumper and front hood and grill and and my two head lamps and on the inside took my seats and hood opener and my rims and swapped it out and kept my car multiple weeks and drove it 570 miles. they also begged for my social security number and i insisted that only my name will be good enough but they insited that it would be a better credit reporting. considering its a law firm and still in business i thought i could trust them and every time i tried to ask about my credit report and what they removed. kept getting the same answer and about a late payment i already got on their and i got an email saying they will try it and remove it for and this after XX/XX/XXXX when i already cancelled the service and still can never answer my questions they would transfer me and i would get sent to voicemail. 
They say they're only open certain times i was working the night shift and i had a problem so i texted them and they responded back to even after hours telling me to get a lawyer from XXXX. and to keep them updated. that they are only for credit repair. but they were saying i am a XXXX  when i am not. 
also they changed my credit card to cash so when i paid at the store it would say i paid in cash which is not true, i paid in credit.! also when i XXXX and they would have mangers give me food and they sign it. and sometimes was no able to press okay or end dash and if my phone was like frozen from being able to press okay. 
also when i reported them fraudulent through my bank they would freeze my phone up and wasn't barely able to use it and most wasn't able to log in to my banking app. and then i paid them and my app would work agian and they also tried to have me change my telephone app toa different app account im guessing the more "" corporate '' version for the work they have done and it was lower than the original amount i had been paying which didn't make sense. 
was my fault i should have asked more questions before signing up i just thought it was good idea because i saw and advertisement saying they can help build credit but it is misleading and not a credit company. they just give you fake credit. 
they also removed some items off my report and will not tell me what they are exactly.i called them everyday and nobody helped me and they keep saying i was blocked.",,5938228

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"My issue is relatively simple. However, getting it fixed has been a matter of bouncing back and forth between my school and my lender for YEARS. 
Back in XX/XX/XXXX, it shows on my credit report that I have late payments regarding my THEN XXXX student loan. The problem is, I was still a student and should have been under deferment but here is what happened. 
Due to some accouningt errors at XXXX University, XXXX showed that I had a balance of more than {$5000.00} that had to be paid back to them in order to get back in school. The whole ordeal lasted 1 year. For the first 3 months, NO ONE knew WHY I owed the balance. I had moved out of state which complicated getting things fixed. I kept getting promises for call backs that never happened. Eventually, XXXX ( spelling may be off ) at XXXX University began helping me with my situation. However, he too kept asking me to give him time to review the situation, something that took an additional several months. He would ask for a few weeks to look over things and when I would followup, he would tell me "" Ohhhh .... I have a meeting about this next week, give me a few more weeks to review this ... '' and that went on for a several months so at this point we are at about 6-7 months of me being out of school. 
Now, when you first get a student loan, you have a 6 month grace period before your loans begin needing to be repaid. Here is where things get interesting. 
When I originally signed up for classes at XXXX, I provided them ( XXXX ) contact information for me such as my personal email address and phone number. That was back in XX/XX/XXXX. The school offered it 's own email address to students but the username and passwording format was always very difficult for me to remember so from DAY ONE that it was given to me, I could never remember the actual email address OR how to access it and never cared to because if we ever needed to use email, we would contact our professors directly using our own personal emails. ( that is important for a reason coming up ). 
So during this extended time of me NOT being in school, my 6 month grace period ( unbeknown to me ) had expired. Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, while my mother was XXXX, I had to take off on a 3 month medical leave of absence and when I came back, I had to redo my financial aid paperwork. This time, the FAO at my school was the one to fill out my XXXX paperwork. NOT ME! And when she did ( her name is XXXX btw ) she gave them my school email. ( Through my own investigation, I found this out much later ) So during this 6 month period where they were stalling and keeping me out of school, they were also reporting to XXXX that I was not enrolled as a student. The truth is they barred me. 
Around this time either XXXX or XXXX etc, was offering a free 1 month membership to students but you had to use your schools XXXX email to register so, I contact IT to get help accessing my email account to do this and noticed that I had been getting email after Email from XXXX telling me they were trying to contact me about a loan. By this time it had been 8 or 9 months of me being out of school. So, they had been trying to contact me about my student loan after my grace period and NOW I was showing as having been Late on payments that would have started after that 6 months. I called them ( XXXX ) to find out how they had gotten that email and asked them how they were contacting me. They specifically admitted they did n't make any calls but contacted me through email only. This may be because they were transitioning from XXXX to the Dept of Education and now Navient around the time. I do n't know. But I have XXXX negative reports to my credit agencies showing I have Late payments for XX/XX/XXXX. Neither company can help me. I disputed with Credit agencies several times with no luck!

There is a man office located at the main entrance of my apartment complex, my apartment complex is also a gated community.

Fraud or scam,"This unfortunate event happened on XX/XX/2018. I was going to buy two tickets for a hockey game from a post from XXXX for {$120.00}. The seller was originally selling four ticket for {$100.00} each, but I only needed two and we agreed on {$120.00} for two tickets. The guy said he was going to transfer me the tickets to my flash-seat account, so I gave him my email address so he could transfer the tickets. I sent the money through XXXX to a XXXX XXXX XXXX account from my Wellsfargo account. In order for me to transfer the money I needed his name and phone number. So the money was sent and no tickets were received. It was a total scam, I tried calling him multiple times and it turns out that he blocked me and the number he gave me was a temporary number, like the ones that you can get online. I called my bank multiple times and was told that the money had already been paid and that they could not do anything. I called my bank the next day again and I was able to open a claim and per Wellsfargo they could not refund me the money and that the money was paid out to a person with a different name and not the name that I was given by the scammer. I don't know how that happened that the money was received by a different account holder name. I did not think that the money could be deposited to an account with a different name. I thought the name had to match and the phone number, but I guess that was not the case. If what I was told by Wellsfargo was correct that the name is not the one that the scammer gave me, I think that person should return me my money. I think that's illegal for someone to keep a money that doesn't belong to them. I also submitted a complaint to XXXX and off course they never responded. I called XXXX and they could not help me, they told me that my bank ( Wellsfargo ) needed to help me. I submitted a police report and they could not help me. So I am not getting help form anyone. I think that either XXXX XXXX  XXXX or Wellsfargo need to give me my money back. I am not happy with Wellsfargo because if they are offering me a service they need to make sure that their consumers are protected either by you ( Wellfargo ) or by XXXX. Wellsfago needs to make sure that there are consumer protection regulations in place and fraud protection with the service that they are offering ( XXXX ). After this incident happened, I did my research and it appears that a lot of the fraud is happening between Wellsfargo and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, also 90 % of the transactions that are done through XXXX are fraud related. Something needs to be done immediately. I felt confident that since my bank was offering a service that they have done all their due diligence to protect the consumer. This can not happen anymore, this needs to stop. I thought I could trust Wellsfargo, but I don't think I can anymore. Yes, I learned my lesson not to send money to anyone through XXXX if I don't know the person. But I would like a full refund on my transaction.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2919525

Managing the loan or lease,"We leased XXXX cars from Nissan on a 39 month lease which were paid for fully per the terms of the lease and when the lease had two weeks left before the cars were required to be turned in we leased XXXX new cars to replace them from XXXX of XXXX Florida and the XXXX dealership told us they would handle the return of our cars so that we would not have to return them ourselves, this took place on XXXX XXXX. XXXX and our lease was up in XXXX XXXX. For reasons still not fully explained, the XXXX dealership failed to return the cars as promised and they sat at their dealership for almost XXXX months before Nissan picked them up and as a result Nissan had started to posted late notices to my wife 's credit report, at no time did Nissan make any attempt to contact us or to inform us that they had not received the cars back, nor did they make any attempt to bill us for the continued use of the cars prior to their finally getting them back, they just went ahead and dinged the credit report. XX/XX/XXXX I received my first correspondence from Nissan saying that the cars had been returned and that I owed almost {$3000.00} in late fees and damages, about the same time I found out that they had been filing late notices with the credit agencies. I called them and asked why they had not told me about the fact that the cars had not been returned or sent me a bill so I would have known and the XXXX said they were not required to do it, I explained that the cars had been returned two weeks prior to the lease end date and had been fully paid prior to the turn in date and she said I would have to provide proof before she could do anything. I went to XXXX and confronted them about the problem as they had never told me that the cars were not returned and the dealer said they would put together new paperwork and send it to Nissan so that the problem would be resolved, they did the paperwork and faxed it to Nissan while I was in the office. As of 45 days later I still had not received a corrected bill and Nissan was continuing to report the account as past due, now reflecting almost six months of being late, I once again contacted Nissan and asked why the problem had not been resolved and the agent told me that they had no record of ever receiving any updated paperwork, so I personally went back to XXXX and had them provide me with new copies of the corrected odometer statements that clearly showed the correct dates and mileage of both cars and their return in XXXX XXXX and I attached them with a letter to Nissan proving their return per my earlier conversations with them and asking them to remove the negative reports from my wife 's files and send me a corrected bill which I would be happy to pay. 
At this point it was XXXX of XXXX and over 7 months of negative reports had been filed, on XXXX XXXX.

After receiving this letter I again called Nissan and explained that the documentation had been enclosed and that this was the third time these documents had been sent to them and I insisted they do something about the credit reports, the gals response was that it was to late they had charged off the account. I truly believe that the whole problem was a result of the fact that we did not get XXXX more Nissans and instead bought from a competitor even though we did try but could not get a decent deal from the local Nissan dealer.

You may have signed a payment authorization, which is sometimes called an ACH Authorization. This gives the payday lender the ability to debit your account when your payment is due. According to Consumer Finance I am well within my rights to request that they revoke payments and I took proper procedures to make the  request. I have a copy of the written request and a picture of my call log making the initial verbal request as proof. I have exhausted all other options and efforts ; and submitting a complaint is the only option I have at this point.",,3359616

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"AES Success mishandled my loans in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and consolidated all of my lower interest loans into XXXX higher interest rate loan. 

AES Success also never removed late fees and penalties on my loans after consolidation. 

AES Success capitalized late fees, penalties and interest on interest into the higher interest rate consolidation. 

AES Success also failed to properly account for principal paydowns in years XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, when I made multiple payments, most of which were directed toward reducing the principal balance. 

I suspect that my current loan balance is overstated by {$4000.00} to {$5000.00} because of too-high interest expense, because of penalties and fees that were capitalized and because of fraudulent calculation of principal and interest payments. 

I request that the CFPB conduct a comprehensive audit of my student loan accounts with AES Success. I first want my interest rate on the consolidated loan to be changed back to the lower rate initially offered to me by AES Success. My consolidated loan 's interest rate is at least 1 % too high. My rate should be much lower!!! 

AES Success mishandled, misadvised and fraudulently handled my student loan application. I have paid dearly for their unprofessionalism. 

I also want a comprehensive audit to calculate all of the late fees, penalties and interest that accrued on my loans prior to consolidation. I want all of the fees and penalties removed, since they were the result of AES Success ' mishandling. 

Lastly, I want a comprehensive audit to calculate the proper amount of principal reductions that should have occurred in periods where I made multiple payments.",,1931311

Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,"Hello, This complaint is in regards to Experian credit bureau. 
I had filed a dispute with the credit bureau itself in regards to the way they where reporting an old credit card debt on my credit report. 
I have been working diligintly to improve my credit since an error I made trying to open an old bankruptcy that I misfiled and it appeared as a new bankruptcy filing in XXXX. This HUGE mistake cost me XXXX points on my credit report in XXXX. I had on e bankruptcy in XXXX and have never missed a payment on anything when this occurred, I was devastated! 
I thought with time it would be noted I had not discharged any debts, I had corrected the error made so believed within a few months this decrease in points would correct itself, it didn't. My score at the time this happened was XXXX and climbing then plumeted to XXXX! 
Who has a score of XXXX with 100 % payment history with no lates? 
Anyway, my account never bounced back and now since then I have been working to rebuild my score again. During the XXXX XXXX Pandemic I ran into an issue with a XXXX credit card. I joined a credit relief program as I was struggling, out of work to pay my debts, XXXX XXXX XXXX  was included however the program I joined was a scam and was costing more to me than if I had made some arrangements with the card itself. 
I had never been late on this card yet this company told me I had to be 90 days behind before they could help. Long story short it was a huge mistake, I got out of the program and by the time I tried to work out somthing with XXXX it was too late, they had already Charged Off the account. It has been over 3 years now since that occurred. 

I continued to pay all my other debts on time and in fact I paid a car loan and a personal loan off XXXX XXXX years early but to my suprise again instead of getting a boost in my score for an early pay off my score dropped about XXXX points, I was disgusted and was told it was because I now did not have various types of accounts therefor I took out a small personal loan, not due to need but simply to have a broader array of accounts. 
My account has been building since and was at XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I filed the dispute with Experian because they where taking this charged off XXXX XXXX  account which has been CLOSED for XXXX years now and they wrongly are continuing to add the balance of this account into and with the amount and total of all my OPEN CURRENT accounts. 
They also have listed under my OPEN ACCOUNTS at total of "" XXXX '' open accounts, which gives the impression this account remains open, as I truly only have "" XXXX '' OPEN and Curent accounts. 
Even though this closed account is not listed with the open accounts, and can not be looked at until you open the drop down accounts listed under, CLOSED accounts, Experian is being decieving to anyone who would looks at my credit profile quickly, as I truly only have "" XXXX '' Open Credit card accounts which together the outstanding balances are usually "" XXXX '' or carry a very low balance, by Experian doing this when you go onto my it is not reflective of what is the thruthful balance of all accounts OPEN & Debt owed, instead they see Old charged off closed information mixed with my current. 
This is deceiving, and has, and is harming my personal credit history and present score. 
THIS is what the problem is : I filed the dispute specifically to Experian to correct the way they where reporting this account as it is NOT an open account but a CLOSED XXXX, and asked them to PLEASE not include the Charged Off OLD account information and amount in with my CURRENT OPEN Accounts. It is deceptive and decieving information. 
This dispute was TO EXPERIAN not XXXX! Experians Error Experian handled this dispute by ignoring what I asked of them and instead took the complaint as if I was diputing the XXXX XXXX as if not mine and sent a confirmation request directly to XXXX which obviously came back confirmed. 
How I found this out is I received an email the dispute had been updated so when I went on line to EXPERIAN I immediately noted my XXXX credit score had dropped by XXXX points and it now stated my score to be XXXX!!! I am so upset by this! At first I could not understand what could have caused the drop in score however Experian specifically guided me to the reason for the change and what it took e to was the dispute I had requested. I could see no obvious changes in what the dispute was showing me so I called EXPERIAN and I was on the phone for over 3 hours with customer service. No one seemed to be able to help me and I was transferred to 4 different departments. I finally reached a woman in the DISPUTE department who finally understood what had happened, she stated that EXPERIAN must have misunderstood the request, and that she was filing a complaint asking for a correction on my account. 
She stated that the reason my credit score dropped XXXX points was due to Experian sending the Dispute to XXXX, She stated this reaged the account as if new! 
I was horrified but I was grateful, as she told me I would have to wait till the next updates at the beginning of the following month however, XXXX has come and the new scores have come out for the month yet I see no reflection of this call nor any change made to my credit score! 
I am furious! I know how difficult it is to get a correction from these agencies!! 
This is not fair! MY score should be at XXXX and climbing! We all know how one thing drops a tremendous amouts of points yet it takes a year or longer to get even close to XXXX points added to a score! This is outrageous! I spent almost a year arguing about XXXX of my other credit cards which was wronfully reporting a 30 day late that took almost a year for it to be removed! It was removed yet I never gained the jump up in points which I had needlessly suffered when it dropped when they originally reported it! Its not right! 
We are not talking XXXX or XXXX points, my score dropped XXXX Points! I might as well have been 30 days late on a payment to receive a drop such as this! 
Due to only being at XXXX although in the good range but not high enough for this not to effect my credit I have gone from a GOOD CREDIT Rating DOWN to a FAIR Rating! 
This is wrong! I told you the situation with the Bankruptcy error I made in XXXX which dropped me XXXX points, despite 100 % payment history and no lates I never recouped any of those points! 
The only true Bankruptcy I had was in XXXX which I built myself up and over XXXX when the error happened in XXXX but I just wanted to mention the XXXX bankruptcy dropped off my credit report in XXXX, I thought my account would receive at least a decent boost from this being removed yet was shocked when after it dropped off it did not reflect even XXXX positive point after! 

These question I have which correspond with my downloaded pictures : DECIETFUL LISTED INFORMATION ON MY REPORT ; a )- The first screenshot is of the email I received, it states its regarding an update to my dispute filed : Report Number XXXX, Date generated XX/XX/XXXX view details > When I did, what I first saw was, "" Could Hurt '' in red, then said : "" The percentage of your accounts always paid on time has *decreased by 10 %. '' ( There had, nor has been any decrease in accounts always paid on time, this is fraudulent information, my accounts are and remain paid 100 % on time, never late ) It then said, "" Your Percentage of accounts with no delinquencies decreased, which means since your last report there is at least XXXX XXXX delinquency on an account that previously didnt have any. '' ( This is flat out "" wrong, '' & deceptful information! In fact I had expected an increase in my score due to bringing an account balance to "" XXXX '' that month! 

b )- Under XXXX account "" Status '' it states Account Charged Off {$11000.00} written off "" XXXX Past Due as of XX/XX/XXXX '' - If account is Charged Off, written off, why is it listing a past due amount? 
- Why does it list an amount of days past due of XXXX? 
- If charged off, written off, why is this reporting in a current status of "" past due "" as of XX/XX/XXXX ''? Yet below "" Staus '' it lists "" States Updated '' XX/XX/XXXX ''? 
- If this is true, & the last staus update states XX/XX/XXXX, why is a current staus listed for XX/XX/XXXX? 
- In the payment History shown in this report it shows the Charge Off occured XX/XX/XXXX - In another photo you can see on the bottom it states : "" Reinvestigation Info '' "" This Item was updated from our processing of your dispute in XX/XX/XXXX. '' This statment is PROOF the change in my score of a XXXX point drop and the drop was directly a consequence of Experian not handeling my dispute properly and instead deflecting my compaint to XXXX instead, this then caused the reaging of my account, looking as if new information reported, rather than the old stale info it is, all due my complaint being handled improperly. The devastating dive in my score is a direct cause of XXXX error themselves, certainly not mine. 
c ) - You will notice in another screenshot at the top it states : "" You have "" XXXX '' open accounts Total Balance {$12000.00} Please understand, my credit score was XXXX and in my reports it would say I need to have more diverse accounts, yet even with my score reaching XXXX I would still be denied credit. I was always told it is due to this XXXX card issue. This is what made me look at it closer and realize what the reason for these troubles where and why this was happening. 
By Experian listing "" XXXX '' under the number of my Open Accounts and then also adding in the total mount of that closed charged off account to the total balance of open accounts, they made my total outstanding balances state {$12000.00} outstanding, as opposed to my true balance of {$1300.00} outstanding from my actual XXXX accounts. 
Experian was creativly and deceptivly keeping my report account inaccurate, still looking as if this closed account was open and I actively owed and stll had over a {$12000.00} current open ballance of Debt therby creating the delusion I was a high risk borrower who owed thousands of dollars in debt! 
d ) - In another screenshot you can see it states : "" XXXX closed accounts '' which is a drop down menu, once it is open This is where I have XXXX closed accounts and where Experian does however list the XXXX account were it belongs with XXXX other prior closed accounts. Although in the correct spot here the damage is done from there wrong actions noted above. 
XXXX ) - Next screen shot you will see a picture dated XX/XX/XXXX where it shows my credit score at XXXX, There is also another screenshot when I received the email of an update to my dispute where the first thing noted on XX/XX/XXXX my score now states XXXX! 
On XX/XX/XXXX my score was still XXXX it was this next day the XXXX it dropped to XXXX. 



I am so upset! Experian obviously made an error when they sent my dispute to XXXX rather than properly reading and realizing this dispute was sent to them to fix and I should not pay for their error and I DEMAND THEY RAISE MY SCORE THE XXXX POINTS THEY SUBTRACTED! 
I FOUGHT FOR THE POINTS TAKEN AWAY AFTER THE XXXX ERROR IN REPORT YET NEVER RECIEVED REPERATION THERE, I HOPE AND PRAY THIS REQUST WILL HAVE A DIFFEENT OUTCOME, PLEASE!

In the documents XXXX XXXX, Vice President & Regional Director-Estate Settlement at Fifth Third Bank, Michigan Area, shared, attached, as proof my inheritance check was sent ( No postmark, no cancelled check, I didnt get it. ). 
I questioned this evidence and asked to file an identity theft report, client complaint and was referred to 5/3 Head Legal Counsel, XXXX XXXX. She then told me to only contact her or XXXX XXXX. For sharing someone stole my money -- - {$10000.00} and simply asking for the cancelled check. To this date there is no evidence of anyone from 5/3 Bank asking me what happened except a XXXX XXXX letter dated XX/XX/XXXX ( how I wish I had one in XXXX ) from XXXX XXXX, Office of the President. No offer of a CTR or discovery of bank fraud. I am still waiting for the fraud team within Financial Crimes Compliance 5/3 Bank -- -- per XXXX XXXX, Senior Vice President, Associate General Legal Counsel of Fifth Third Bank -- XXXX, email attached. Im told, 5/3 Bank cant find the cancelled {$10000.00} check -- -too old. I say the statute of limitations began at first discovery of harm XX/XX/XXXX. We are in a digital age -- -How didnt this get digitally documented? 
XXXX XXXX XXXX shared their evidence from the transactions as well, in fact that is when I was referred to XXXX XXXX ( First Legal Counsel ( see credentials elsewhere -- -Im an XXXX XXXX XXXX. ) and told to stop contacting ANYONE else but her and XXXX XXXX at 5/3 Bank  XXXX. I had asked XXXX boss, XXXX XXXX, if I could file a customer complaint against XXXX XXXX because of the two memos shared by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This was the response. I guess I need to stop doing that.

The memo XXXX XXXX shared in XXXX is cleaned up -- -- it is no longer my sister calling -- - but ME. I DID NOT make that call. All the names are correctly spelled and the date and time show a revision. This is what proves 5/3 Bank did their due diligence to obtain my address in XXXX.

Ive been trying to file a customer complaint with 5/3 Bank XXXX, MI and now Headquarters, Ohio. I finally researched the President and VP of 5/3 Bank on my own to share my customer complaint. I emailed my request for identity theft/fraud help and customer complaint to both of them. Mr. XXXX responded. I am now at the Office of the President telling me they met their obligation as trustee. How? No proof. No CTR. NO HEIR confirming receipt.

"Managing, opening, or closing account","I called Rushcard to dispute a charge on my account. The woman said it would take approximately 90 days to handle the dispute. She said it would be faster to get my daughter to give me the {$88.00} back which was the charge amount, because it was from her insurance making the charge to my account. I had previously paid my daughter 's Insurance the month before and apparently the insurance company had went ahead and took out her insurance charge again the next month. Then the woman proceeded to say that she had to cancel my card and that it was standard procedure. I told her that she could not cancel my card, because I had a direct deposit coming through the next day that I needed and that I needed my funds to take care of my bills and my children. I told her not to cancel my card. I told her several times not to cancel my card and that I needed my funds to take care of my family and my bills. I told her she better not cancel my card. She kept saying she had to cancel my card. I told her I needed to speak to her supervisor. After all the time she spent on the phone saying she had to cancel my card she never really handled what I called about which was disputing the insurance charge. After I was on hold for a long time I talked to the supervisor who checked my account and said that the card had been cancelled by the previous woman she then proceeded to tell me that it would take 7 days to get me another card ; however, she could charge me {$30.00} to get me an expedited card which she would take out of my direct deposit when it hit the next day. My complaint is that I never wanted my card cancelled in the first place I told the lady that I intended to cancel my card myself after I received my direct deposit and that I did not want her to cancel my card and that I would do it myself and that I feel I should not have been charged {$30.00} for an expedited card when I did not want my card cancelled in the first place.",,2186854

Trouble using your card,"On XX/XX/XXXX - When attempting to make an online purchase using my CitiBank CitiAdvantage Platinum Card, I received an email and text message stating suspicious activity had taken place on my card and to call CitiBank to resolve. Considering I had just attempted the transaction, I assumed I would just need to call and confirm the transaction. I immediately called the CitiBank Fraud Department where I was asked to state my name and my account code word for identity verification, which I promptly did. I was then told I needed to provide the phone number on my account to further verify my identity, which I did. CitiBank then placed me on hold while they verified my account information. The fraud representative came back and asked if there was a different number I could provide for a "" callback '' as the number I provided could not verify my account. This was surprising because I have had the same phone number my entire life and it is the same number that I received the Fraud Alert text on. The representative told me they are unable to provide any more information on the account for identity protection purposes and they would need to send a letter in the mail to verify my identity, during which time I would be locked out of my account completely. I told them that was not the route I wanted to take and to speak with a supervisor, who gave the same information word-for-word, without providing any explanation as to why I could not access my account anymore, not even to confirm there was a potential fraud on my account. Over several calls, I continually asked why I was asked to call the Fraud Department if I could not even speak with them regarding the issue nor receive an explanation as to what was going on, causing a large amount of emotional distress. Further distress is being caused by CitiBank as I have payments that must be made which can not now and will collect interest due to CitiBank 's frivolous locking of my account against my will. I researched the topic and it appears this has been an issue for CitiBank Cardholders for several years. Some testimonials referenced alternative methods for verification that worked for them in the past, such as verification from another bank, Driver License, Mailing Address, etc. I called CitiBank Fraud Department again, as well as the Main Customer Service Desk and offered several methods of verification. I was met each time with no assistance other than asking me for other numbers for them to callback on, which made me start to wonder if this was a fraudulent act in of itself. I asked the Fraud Department to file a complaint on my behalf as I feel it was unethical to lock me out of my account with no explanation and subject me to potential emotional and financial distress even though my number is clearly on file, or how could they have sent me a Fraud Alert Text? It was also concerning to see numerous online threads dating to XXXX regarding this exact issue at Citibank, with some customers waiting for up to three ( 3 ) letters, each with deliveries of over ten ( 10 ) days.

Fraud or scam,"Met a person through reddit who agreed to sell me a game console and games. We agreed to use cashapp as the money transferring service. Upon sending the funds, the person ghosted me and never sent tracking, shipped anything out, refunded me ect. I've contacted cashapp multiple times about the issue in an attempt to get my money refunded. Everytime they give me the same generic excuse. I try to show them info that shows the person in question ghosting me and they say they "" don't need that info ''. How can you run a money transfer service and offer no help in regards to getting a persons money back? If the transaction was made on your site and I have proof to show that nothing was received on my end, why would you not investigate the situation in an attempt to retrieve my funds? I marked the transaction as a scam and put in a request to receive my money back. When I called cashapp on the phone to get an idea of how that process works and what exactly they do in order to retrieve the funds, they made it sound as if they had no actual intention of trying to do so. In which case, why include a message stating that your looking into getting my money back upon filing for a refund on the item if that's not actually the intention? 

As for dates and times, I initiated the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. The person was supposed to ship on XX/XX/XXXX. After 2 days of no response, I contact cashapp through chat on XX/XX/XXXX. As stated above, they were no help. Called them as well on either XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX which as I stated above, also amounted to nothing. 

The amount in question is for {$95.00} total. 

I included screen shots of the conversation with the person as well as my final message to him on the XXXX which he still hasn't replied to.

Managing the loan or lease,"I submitted a Lease Takeover Document back to Nissan ( NMAC ) which was received by them 30 days late because of the Pandemic. 

Covid-19 caused large delays in logistics around the world and shut down a large majority of XXXX distributions centers. Overall, the pandemic caused the full lease takeover documents to be delayed by 30 days, however, I was told by a Nissan representative over the phone that I would be granted an extended grace period because of the pandemic ( they would accept the documents ) unless she called to tell me otherwise by end of day XX/XX/2020. 

She never called me, which i assumed meant we are all good to go as she told me on the phone. The documents were received by Nissan and discarded on the XXXX of XXXX, 2020. I never received a phone call back, I am now living in XXXX where the vehicle is not allowed to be. I can't afford to make payments on the vehicle anymore. I have pleaded with Nissan for months now to please retain the documents as the man taking over the lease still wants the vehicle and I am still trying to have it taken over. Its in everyone 's best interest to file the documents through and allow the transfer to happen. I do not understand why this process has been like pulling teeth, everyone is on board and following the playbook except Nissan. They have been TERRIBLE to work with. I have been struggling with Nissan and this vehicle for over 3 months now fighting on a weekly, sometimes daily basis with Nissan.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"I had a Capital One credit card, ending in XXXX, with an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX, show up on my credit report as being delinquent due to a purchase at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX for around {$25.00}, total due showing as {$89.00} due to late fees and interest charges. 

After seeing this information on my credit report, and that it had dropped by credit score by nearly XXXX points, I contacted Capital One to discuss the matter. I told them that I had not used the card in close to 8 years and that the card had expired on XX/XX/XXXX. They were also able to confirm this. I also had never renewed the card when it expired on XX/XX/XXXX. Certainly the account would have been automatically closed within nearly a 4 year timespan of the card expiring as well. 

Not only did I not make any purchases with the Capital One card for nearly 8 years, on the date of the transaction, I was in the hospital with my with my wife and XXXX daughter who was born at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Capital One advised me that it was an actual credit card swipe on location at a XXXX XXXX store. While I can imagine a credit card purchase being done online using an expired credit card, the expiration date is coded into the magnetic strip which would not process at any modern POS credit card processor. 

I was prompted to look at my credit report due to the fact that I was denied a credit card that I had recently applied for. This never happens as I have an excellent credit score. This is when I noticed that Capital One was reporting this card as delinquent. 

Capital One should never have authorized any transaction on an expired account/credit card. Not only did they allow the transaction to process, but it was done so fraudulently. As a result, they reported inaccurate information to the credit bureaus which has directly affected my ability to obtain credit. 

Capital One did not directly address the issue of why the transaction was allowed to occur, but they did state that they will send me out a fraud application to fill out and I will receive notice of their pending investigation. 

I believe that the fraud application is a moot issue due to the fact that the credit card transaction should not have been allowed to occur in the first place, however, I will fill it out and return it per their instructions. 

The credit card I was denied because of the derogatory remark from Capital One was having a promotion that if you signed up for the card, you would get {$100.00} credit on the issuer 's website. I am seeking {$100.00} in compensation.",,1299553

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"I submitted a written dispute to Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX. It was confirmed received on XX/XX/XXXX by Supervisor representative XXXX ID # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received notification of my dispute results by electronic mail, USPS mail or otherwise. I called in to inquire about this on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with 4 different representatives who all confirmed and acknowledged receipt of the dispute as XX/XX/XXXX.It was processed by their office on XXXX XXXX and according to their records all creditors validated the accounts as accurate all on the same day of XX/XX/XXXX, and they also mailed me a copy of the results on XX/XX/XXXX. It would appear highly unlikely that 11 account holders would respond on the same day and results would get mailed on the same day of response since it took almost 2 weeks for my dispute to get processed. Please note : I have not received a copy of that response and verified my mailing address as accurate. 

Even if this information is true, my dispute was confirmed received on XX/XX/XXXX. It has exceeded 30 days as required by FDCPA guidelines to respond to my written request for validation and therefore must be deleted. 

I called Equifax on XX/XX/XXXX and explained this to several representatives who all refused to have the disputes removed from my report. This is gross negligence and in complete violation of my personal rights. 

In addition, there is a Bankruptcy that is being inaccurately reported on my credit report from XX/XX/XXXX. I have reached out to Equifax on 3 different occasions to have it properly investigated and removed as it does not belong to me along with numerous accounts that are being reported as written off in bankruptcy. I'm being told that it has been verified through XXXX XXXX which a 3rd party used by the court system to verify this account. This is 100 % inaccurate as I have a letter from XXXX XXXX stating that my information is not reported by them to anyone. A copy of this letter has been supplied to Equifax and has gone completely ignored. I have attached a copy of this letter for your review. 

At this point my rights have been violated on several instances, I have spent hours on the phone with representatives who disregard are either uneducated on FDCPA guidelines or totally disregard them. I have provided evidence that the bankruptcy validation source is invalid and asked for them to provide me with a copy of the validation received and have denied access to my records.",,3551375
Managing the loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX i purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX. The loan for this vehicle is handled by Bridgecrest LLC.

I need to be able to open a new account for the XXXX XXXX ; putting these 2 loans together in one account is, in my opinion, highly questionable, if not illegal.

Getting a credit card,"Wells Fargo has used the past national scandal involving widespread abuse of the application process by its representatives to practice widespread discrimination -- according to the perceived ethnicity and/or racial background of applicants over the phone -- in the form of a policy of doing hard inquiries on consumer credit files in connection with any and all applications for Wells Fargo consumer financial products, without having any intention to compete the application, until and unless the applicant phones in. Long before I adopted my recent practice of freezing my credit files, Wells Fargo has always been the only financial institution I have ever encountered that consistently requires me to phone in to verify my identity in connection with an application of any kind, which I have been informed today by a Wells Fargo representative is standard procedure with Wells Fargo. Although Wells Fargo will doubtless claim that this is a means for Wells Fargo to address past widespread abuse of the application process by Wells Fargo representatives, it also serves ( intentionally or not ) to provide Wells Fargo with an opportunity to practice widespread discrimination based on the perceived ethnicity and/or racial background of applicants over the phone ( I myself am of XXXX-Descent ). 

By way of example, my application for a VISA Cash Wise Credit Card ( Reference # : XXXX ) was declined over the phone today ( I had received an email from Wells Fargo last night indicating that I needed to phone in for my application to be processed, 22 minutes before I got an email notification from XXXX that my credit file had been accessed by Wells Fargo ), supposedly because I have too many unused credit cards. Although it is conceivable that this could be a legitimate reason for declining a credit card application, it is one that I have not previously encountered or heard of in 20 years as an avid e-consumer. More to the point, it is blatantly fraudulent for Wells Fargo to have a policy of doing hard inquiries on consumer credit files in connection with applications for a consumer financial products without having any intention to actually process the application until and unless the applicant phones in. 

Of particular concern is an application I submitted online on XX/XX/2017 for Wells Fargo Ways2Save and Everyday Checking accounts ( Reference # : XXXX, in response to a Wells Fargo flyer sent to me by U.S. Mail ). The application was immediately conditionally approved via email pending my return of a signed & dated standard Consumer Account Application form, only to have Wells Fargo send me a second email 10 days later requiring me to phone in for my application to be processed, which I did not do, since I suspected it was a ruse on the part of Wells Fargo to use the national scandal involving pervasive fraudulence on the part of its representatives as a pretext for practicing widespread discrimination -- and which I phoned in today specifically to confirm ( I only unfroze my credit files yesterday through the end of next month because I am in the process of moving and have no plans to apply for any more consumer loans or financial products of any kind ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3409157

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"My Student Loans are currently being serviced by Navient. In this environment of historically low interest rates, the interest rate on my loans are 4.5 %. The legal agreement does not specify how they are calculating my interest rate in full. It only states that it uses the prime interest rate plus some margin rate but it does n't explain how it calculates this margin rate. In speaking with the company they change their story about how this figure is derived. Additionally, there are several administrative errors on my legal agreement such as labeling the loan as being for a graduate student when the loan was taken out to cover my under-graduate degree. Furthermore, they charged me a $ XXXX repayment fee the day I began repaying the loan. The contract states that they may charge me a repayment fee but it does not specify how much this fee is and {$1000.00} seems very egregious. I do n't think most people expect this fee to be $ XXXX or about 3.5 % of the loan. Lastly, my loans were accumulating interest while I was still a student which seems wrong to do to a XXXX XXXX XXXX but after doing some research I found that this was in fact permitted by the contract and by law. Nevertheless, this seems incredibly unfair to do to a XXXX XXXX XXXX college student who does n't have a job or money ( hence why I took out a loan ) and resulted in {$5000.00} of additional interest before ever graduating, having a job, or the having the means to pay off the loan. 
I have called the company and complained about these things and they told me that all of this is within their rights per the contract. 

I graduated college in 2006 and after over 10 years, I still have nearly 75 % of the loan to pay off. Please let me know if I have any recourse for any of these things or if you can suggest a better way of managing these loans.

They said my only option to get it removed from my credit report was to pay it in full. They refused to send proof, or agree to remove it at the request of the hospital.

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and the fact that the bank representative admitted that my account was closed wrong on their end means that Bank of America needs to acknowledge their error that is causing negative effects on both my credit and life in addition to the stress this is causing me. 

At the moment, I have no intention to escalate this and I am simply seeking both an apology and for them to make this situation right including having the delinquency due to their error removed from my credit report.

Given I had XXXX months interest free financing, I just diveded by XXXX and set my bill pay to send {$120.00} each month. On XXXX my XXXX {$120.00} payment was made. When I got a collection notice it showed the payment received but a late charge of {$25.00}. I immediately paid all the remaining principle of {$370.00} on XXXX and currently have a {$25.00} balance made exclusively of the fee. When I contacted Wells Fargo at XXXX they transferred me. The rep I spoke to spoke to his supervisor XXXX times about my situation and XXXX times said he could not waive the fee even after I explained the situation. When I asked to file a complaint, the rep was n't aware of anyway to file a complaint. He offered for me to speak with his supervisor. I spoke with supervisor "" XXXX '' who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did n't make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize, is even though the account has credit card access they based the minumum payment on 3.5 % of the ORIGINAL balance. My accelerated payments did n't do anything to change the minimum on what I thought was a credit card account. Because I planned out my payment strategy up front, I did n't look at the billing as they came and did n't realize their unusual therefore to a small extent deceptive minimum payment process. When I asked how frequently they get these issues, they would not answer, which makes me think it is fairly common. I sincerely believe there is an ongoing business practice to extract fees from otherwise interest free accounts without regard to customer concern or reasonable waiver policies. They went as far to partially blame current regulatory environment for not allowing discretionary waivers. My hope with this complaint is to get the {$25.00} fee waived if possible, but more importantly to ensure Wells Fargo Financial National Bank is required to have a better complaint program than they seem to. They only took the billing dispute when I made them and did not know about any complaint program. Then to make matters worse the billing dispute can take XXXX days - my balance would have been paid off for over XXXX days by that point. They do n't need 60 days.",,1305128

Late fee,"BP Credit Cards were issued by XXXX. XXXX has been replaced by Synchrony-offices in XXXX and XXXX, XXXX. With XXXX, we were set up to have our monthly balance automatically subtracted from our checking account. With XXXX, we received our first statement, with a late fee of {$25.00} and a interest fee of {$7.00}, on a balance of {$790.00}. Our account number is XXXX. I contacted Customer Service, XXXX times. First the fees were dropped, then I was told how to register my account, on a site, to have the balance taken out automatically-this does not work! Another call told me that I would receive a XXXX card, between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I could then register the new card, with the XXXX digit number. My concerns are : ( 1 ) what if I had not contacted the new bank-I would have paid unnecessarily and my credit rating would drop, ( 2 ) I plan to be XXXX XX/XX/XXXX-if I do not receive the statement in a timely manner, will I again receive a late charge and interest charge? This could also damage my credit rating. ( 3 ) Is this the best way to do business? You receive late charges, with damage to your credit rating, and you do not have the tools to make the corrections. How much money is collected by banks that automatically charge fees which you can not avoid, since you do not have the correct tools to stop the problem?",,1415592

Please see ( PDF ) to Title Max Corporation and Title Max XXXX, Texas XXXX ; requesting my Car Title back after my Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy was discharged. 
Title Max is in violation of selling and trading consumer information through Third Party transaction and violating Federal Bankruptcy Order 11 U.S.C 727 ; which was granted to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ; Order of Discharge Case Number:XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was harassed by XXXX XXXX and other Third Party Debt collectors and was forced to file for Federal Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy as a XXXX consumer ; in XX/XX/XXXX due to aggressive collection acts and deception trade practices. Title Max has ignore the discharge order as of today ; they are violating Federal laws under section 524 of Title 11 of the United States Codes ; known as A Bankruptcy Discharged Violation. We both know that an injunction states that no one can take any action against a consumer regarding a discharged debt that has been exempt or granted under the United States Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy Order. 
The reason for this complaint is because Title Max is still trying to repossess my car by having Title Max employee following me ; however I have my car in my possession ; my car is exempt. Title Max and all creditors were notified by Untied States Government  Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy of my Chapter XXXX Discharged. 
However, according to ( CFPB ) Effective Date : This regulation is effective January 16, 2018 and the Compliance Date : Sections 1041.2 through 1041.10, 1041.12, and 1041.13 have a compliance date of August 19, 2019 ; The rule identifies it as an unfair and abusive practice ; and the proposal was published in the Federal Register on July 22, 2016.

Due to the denial and reversal, I did not trust anything else she stated. 

The timing of the fee increases coinciding with a declared national emergency is too perfect, especially when competing banks are openly announcing relief programs for customers.

Getting a credit card,"Up until this point I have had no issues with American Express. I have never missed payments, never had poor experiences, etc. That unfortunately has changed. Recently my wife and I both applied for the Delta Gold card ( within the past month ). She was instantaneously approved whilst I was asked to provide "" more documentation ''. This already felt odd from the outset given my credit history is substantially longer and my credit score was also higher than hers. She even had a small but nonetheless open collections account that we had been unaware of at the time of her application. Yet she was still instantaneously approved and I was not. 

I received a letter in the mail from Amex demanding that the documentation I provide by mortgage statements/home insurance statements etc. I also need to provide proof of my name! This is when it became apparent that I was suffering discrimination and the XXXX was being violated. My wife and I recently became homeowners and thus our address changed on our Amex accounts we were now owners instead of renters. Why was she not asked to provide supplemental documentation. Why is it just assumed that she is being entirely truthful and forthright about her address. Simply put, she has an entirely Caucasian name. We have not processed a last name change yet and thus her name comes off as entirely Caucasian. Both my first and last name clearly suggest I am a non-white person. The insinuation hear is that I as a non-white person I am not as creditworthy and may have made a false statement in claiming that I own a home ( or even gave a false name according to Amex?! ). This is simply unacceptable. 

Perhaps the true final nail in the coffin was my wife had never remembered to change her address when we became homeowners. Amex had my new address already, but they hadn't had hers. She had applied for something else previously ( and was instantly approved ), and informed me she got a letter from Amex saying it appeared her address in her account was potentially incorrect. Yet she was still approved instantly. Amex changed the address in her account on her behalf, and just simply accepted the fact that it's her home. Honestly, my credit report clearly shows both my address as well as my mortgage. It's absurd.

Incorrect information on credit report,"I 've attached a PDF that explains what I 've attempted to have removed from the XXXX credit bureaus. My XXXX frustration and complaint is the inconsistency of reporting between the XXXX bureaus.My XXXX frustration and complaint is the inability to remove someone else 's public record ( Judgement ) that is on XXXX of XXXX of my reports. My final frustration and complaint is the fact that there are multiple levels of credit reporting and scoring ( consumer and industry ) that are only available to industries such as Mortgage, Credit Cards, and Auto. These industry level credit reports vary greatly from the consumer reporting and scoring. And they are fraught with errors greater than the consumer reports. In my case the mortgage credit report has scores 25 % lower than my consumer report and the XXXX public records on my consumer report are duplicated to show XXXX public records on the mortgage report. XXXX has someone else 's address and refuses to correct it to my address and they have XXXX public records that have {$0.00} as the amount ... yet they refuse to remove. These public records are explained in the PDF I 've uploaded to you and they need to be removed ASAP. XXXX has removed the judgement XXXX XXXX of XXXX public records ). Experian also refuses to remove the XXXX public records. The only good news is that on my consumer reports a XXXX lien of {$120.00} was removed by all three consumer reports BUT is present on my Mortgage report ( All XXXX Bureaus ). In other words, the XXXX bureaus remove the {$120.00} lien that was in error, but kept them on the mortgage reporting and scoring!! So, in conclusion I see no purpose or value to the consumer reporting and scoring since the lenders, be it auto, mortgage or credit card, have significantly different scores and reports from the same XXXX bureaus ... and removing from the consumer products does n't guarantee removal from the industry product. This is so unfair on every level. And the consumer has no access or ability to contest or correct the industry level credit reports or scores!!

Payoff process,"I tried to buy gift cards on XXXX. I was buying {$570.00} in value for {$500.00} from PayPal Digital Gifts on XXXX. I applied {$320.00} in XXXX bucks which brought my total down to {$170.00}. Then I clicked on pay with PayPal button. A screen popped up asking me to log into my PayPal account. When I logged in, PayPal flagged my account and would not let me complete the transaction stating that I had to choose another message. 

PayPal is the problem here. In addition to not being able to use make the purchase, they have also flagged my XXXX bucks, making it so that I can not use them. The XXXX bucks are time sensitive and expire XXXX XXXX. I do NOT want to buy anything else but gift cards with my XXXX bucks. When I appealed to the highest manager that I could at Paypal, XXXX # XXXX, he was not responsive to the situation and said he could n't do anything about, refused to help and said I could write to the office of the VP. WRITE. Not talk, but write to them. This is a time sensitive issue and the value of the XXXX bucks will expire on XXXX XXXX if I can not use them in addition to the time sensitive nature of the sale and product availability. Additionally, since their risk system "" flagged '' my account, for no reason, I can not use my account and I have no way of making gift card purchases. There is no way to appeal or get the "" flag '' overridden or lifted. I get empty risk control phrases as actual answers such as : You have to wait and let the system cool down. Or, Try using a different device : mobile phone, tablet or computer ( this will also create an issue in the risk system when it sees multiple attempts at using a different device and lock you out ). 
That all makes ZERO sense. They are basically preventing me from making a purchase, that is on sale, for a limited amount of time, so I lost out on the discounted price, furthermore, they have flagged my XXXX bucks therefore stranding them and I can NEVER USE THEM which means I lose out on {$320.00}. 

PayPal is destroying sales for XXXX by rejecting them. The only way to buy a gift card is through PayPal. PayPal locks me out of making a purchase and provides the explanation that the account is overheated and needs to cool down. Meanwhile, no valid explanation is given, nor can be overrode, on a timely basis. PayPal suffers no loss, meanwhile I lose out on a sale price, or even the item permanently. 

I have spoken with XXXX about this and have complained that my ability to make purchases is becoming impossible due to PayPal. PayPal is not a "" pal ''. They are XXXX, or XXXX. The inability to make a valid purchase is costing me money. XXXX realizes that this is an issue and I know of several and can enlist a vendor that can provide several hundred others that are in the same situation as myself. We all buy gift cards -- or at least attempt to buy them. 
XXXX is NOT happy about this and PayPal just is n't responsive. They offer no compensation. They have nobody with actual authority to make system overrides or manual transactions happen. They just say, Too bad. You are out of luck. This is discriminatory at worst and incompetent at best. 

The resolution that I want is to be able to make the purchase of those Lowe 's gift cards of {$570.00} in value for {$500.00}. And, because of all the time, aggravation and frustration of having to resolve ( or unable to resolve ) PayPal 's refusal issues, I want compensation for my time to be {$1000.00}. This is not my first, second, third or even tenth time I have had this issue and it MUST STOP. 

PayPal needs to make some changes that will not lock us out of losing out on a sale or prevent us from making a purchase on limited availability items.",,2164968

Billing disputes,"For at least a year or longer, Macy 's has messed up the accounting on my credit card, which I 've had for well over a decade. I just tried several times to reach it at a so-called customer service number ( XXXX ). It is impossible to reach anyone there, as there are numerous phone loop recordings at that number. Among other things, Macy 's lowered my credit limit, allegedly because XXXX provided it with a false credit report. It should have gotten a ( partially ) corrected copy of it by now, as I asked XXXX several times to provide one. However, throughout the last year, Macy 's continued with numerous, habitual errors, even after I called several times to correct it and was told that it was corrected. For example, it habitually mailed checks for balances on my account, then treated my account as though I cashed the check with the credit balance when I did not. I would call Macy 's about this, with little to no avail. Macy 's continued to show less on my account even when I had overpaid it and had a balance on it, with the difference explained by a lost or uncashed check, often one that I 'd told Macy 's about. Then when it received no additional payment, it charged me phony late fees. I would call to have that corrected and often was told that it would be when it was not. One example appears to be a {$2.00} charge from XXXX XXXX, 2015 that I should not have. Add to these problems ( of claiming that uncashed checks eliminated credit balances, then using that to charge illicit fees ), as is the case today, no one can be reached at the numbers printed on bills, so there is no way to verify even the false balances Macy 's has been attributing to me throughout the last year or longer. As I write, I just heard a recorded voice tell me that my balance was {$73.00} and change, but I have little idea of what explains it, since I have not gotten a bill and can not reach anyone at their so-called customer service center. I have not gotten a bill from Macy 's in months and can not reach anyone there to discuss this and other problems.

She listed the property, took pictures of the home, showed it to a dozen investors and had an offer made for over {$90000.00}. My current pay off was roughly {$120000.00}.

After 30 days passed, with no response, she reached out to the company and was told that it had not been approved because I had not completely a hardship application. I have completed this form and all provided all the supporting documentation at least four times.

Nonetheless, I did it again. I received a notification that there were corrections needed in my information. I called to find out what i needed to do and was told that the short sale was no longer an option and I could only apply for a loan modification at this time.

I have spoken to numerous representatives countless time and never gotten the same answer to any question or issue twice. My agent and I could call on the same day and get two different responses.

Throughout this extended process, the mortgage company has rarely contacted me regarding any information needed, always waiting until i contact them.

Meanwhile, I get two - three letters a week from them with different information on each one.

I feel like this entire process has been a huge run around.

I am very close to giving up and allowing it to go to foreclosure.

I am totally frustrated and confused as to why the mortgage company would reject an offer that would pay off 75 % of the remaining loan and take the property off their hands.

I feel that I have made every reasonable effort and beyond to come up with an agreeable solution to my mortgage issue.

I failed to mention that the reason I left the home and want to get out of the mortgage is that I left my husband and am now paying rent on an apartment. My ex-husband has remained in the house without paying anything toward the property. In addition to paying my own living expenses a large portion of my income is paid to him in spousal support as he is unemployed and applying for XXXX.

The company I have been dealing with is Select Portfolio Services.

I have written to their ombudsmen, but have not gotten a response at this time.

SPS has been terrible regarding communication and seem to have no desire to settle this issue.

"Managing, opening, or closing your mobile wallet account","Hello, I am from XXXX, XXXX. 

I have registered a personal account via PayPal. I mostly receive personal payments from friends, work, send payments to friends or pay for digital services or items. I do not own a website. I had no complaints or disputes on my account. My account is in full compliance with the acceptable use policy as I never attempted selling anything that is against the "" acceptable use policy ''. 

At XX/XX/2023 I received an unexpected email from PayPal : "" We're initiating closure of your PayPal account After a review of your account activity, we've determined that you're in violation of PayPal 's Acceptable Use Policy. As a result, your account has been permanently limited and you won't be able to conduct any further business using PayPal. This is permitted under the PayPal User Agreement sections Restricted Activities and Actions We May Take. You must remove all references to PayPal from your website ( s ) and/or auction ( s ), including removing PayPal as a payment option, the PayPal logo XXXX and the PayPal shopping cart.You 'll no longer be able to use PayPal account. XXXX ( Ref ID - XXXX ) PayPal failed to provide a reason to justify how they unlawfully locked my money and permanently closed my account. I believe that I was deceived by PayPal as they failed to provide the payment service promised taking advantage of me as their customer to steal my money in a clear case of unjust enrichment. 

I have heard of and also seen multiple cases of individuals that lost all of their money due to this. PayPal actions are considered a breach of their own agreements as they steal all hard earned money and empty balances to reach XXXX! 
I have been informed that PayPal debit random amounts to empty balance that doesn't represent any genuine pre-estimate of loss or damages. Under the common law, liquidated damages may not be set so high that they are penalty clauses rather than fair compensation. PayPal 's actions of stealing the whole balance wouldn't even stand in court because under the common law, liquidated damages may not be set so high that they are penalty clauses rather than fair compensation. I refuse to be a victim of this! 

I believe PayPal acts in bad faith as a payment company and fails to offer the promised service. I believe that I was deceived, scammed and slandered by PayPal and I want to complain about this corrupt act. 

They did not empty my balance as of yet, as it has been two weeks since this occured, however I do not want to wait the full 180 days just for them to empty my balance, thus why I am taking actions against their unlawful actions. I am not looking to conduct any further business with their service, as this has left me traumatized. I am simply asking for my own hard earned money. I kept my money on their app as I never expected anything such as this to occur. They are now stating that they are holding my funds for 180 days. It is worth to mention that half and more of my balance has been sitting on my account for over 180 days, making it eligible for a withdrawal. According to their 180-day policy for "" disputes '' and "" chargebacks '' in my case, I am applicable to withdraw at least half of my funds right now, but they did not even give me that option and I refused to do so when I asked them to. 

They are holding XXXX EUR in total from me. 

The court, not a corporation, needs to determine my guilt and the appropriate punishment. PayPal has no right to take my money without trial! and with no DUE process! 
They never contacted me to warn me, they just suddenly closed my account and locked my funds. They never offered me a way to obtain any due process. 
They did not let me explain whether my activity is in violation of their acceptable use policy. They never gave me any explanation or never told me what exact policies I have violated. 

I kindly asked them to give a qualified comment about the incident via the on-site support, XXXX and via email but I was not getting any real responses other than automated / bot / FAQ response.

I am not requesting that my account be re-opened or allowed to continue to use the PayPal service. I am courteously asking for my own hard earned money. 

This complaint is against PayPals main entity ( Parent Company ) : PayPal Holdings , Inc.

Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"My son, bless his heart, gave me a {$25.00} Mastercard Gift Card for XXXX last year. He paid {$3.00} to have it activated. I put it away to use in a few months for something I really wanted - the card was NEVER OUT OF MY POSSESSION in fact IT WAS NEVER OUT OF MY HOUSE. I signed up online to validate the card but then I put it away. When I finally tried to use the card about 3 months later it was denied and when I looked online 3 charges had been made that used up the card. The card has never been out of my possession and it is very suspicious that all 3 of the charges were made at a XXXX Gas Station in XXXX, Missouri and XXXX, Missouri which is close to where my son bought the card. I called right away and was told to fax in a bunch of stuff which I did and had to pay for the fax fee. Then later they said MAIL US SOME STUFF which I did and paid for postage - a month later they wrote me and said SORRY YOU WAITED too long - there is a 3-month time period you have to contact us by. They did n't say 3-months past what? It should n't matter because THEY CHOSE to allow charges to be made without the card present. But it does n't matter to them because they got their money so XXXX me and my son too. But it was not 3 months past the last charge was added but there is no warning that people copy the 3-digit code and can use these. They say KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE which I did - they do n't warn you that you better check it EVERY DAY or someone might steal your money. So this is just wrong - they let the money be stolen and they do n't warn you when you buy it that they will let someone steal your money. If I had the card locked up in a bank vault somewhere would have made no difference. They do n't care they got their money - they had me jump thru their hoops and they ignore the attorney general and I am frankly XXXX this is LEGALIZED THEFT. If its a credit or a debit card you have some recourse but with "" Gift Cards '' ( should be called ROB YOU OF YOUR MONEY CARDS ) they thumb their nose at you and send a letter after you jump their hoops saying "" we 're so sorry ( yeah right ) but there 's nothing we can do because its past 3 months ''. They CAN do something - they can do the right thing but they do n't want to because they are crooks. I have alread spent so much time and money pursuing this - my son did n't give me this gift so I could waste 40 or so hours trying to get {$25.00} - he got screwed and so did I but TOO BAD. So I contacted the Missouri Attorney General and took great care getting all the documents and attachments just right and they finally wrote the company and the company ignored them so it is nearly a year now since my son gave me the card and I have spent 100 's of ours pursuing this and I have had expenses jumping thru the company hoops after which they told me WE ARE SO SORRY WE CA N'T HELP YOU ARE TOO LATE.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I have Private Student Loans with Navient my co-signer is a US Veteran XXXX from approximately from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX. My initial loans were generated in XX/XX/XXXX because my course of study was not covered by Federal Loans ( so I was told ). The amounts of the loans were XXXX at 5.25 % generated on XX/XX/XXXX and {$4000.00} generated on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. When I graduated, I had to request forbearance because my husband was unemployed, and I was handling some of my stepson 's bills, paying rent and I could not afford to pay the loans back. I told them at the time that since my stepson was XXXX I had to cover some of his bills and mine and was financially strained so I asked for deferments and forbearances. My step-son left the military and was without a job in XX/XX/XXXX. My husband and I had to support him for about 2 1/2 years. We had pay cuts due to the financial crisis and I asked for a hardship forbearance. They told me I had used them all up but that to protect my account I could make interest only payments. So I did. I was very stressed with all the federal and signature loans and financially strained. In XX/XX/XXXX I was diagnosed with the beginnings of XXXX XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I started XXXX. I had XXXX in all from XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX. I had contacted XXXX XXXX to obtain a medical deferral and/or forbearance which they say they granted. When I finished my treatments late in XXXX I was behind on many of my bills and I had to start paying student loans with XXXX XXXX / Navient. I told them that I was still struggling financially and they said they would work with me that I could set up post-dated payments under a new program they had and once again they stated this would protect my account. I was never told the program was not approved and I thought they acted in good faith as I had considering I had been through a XX/XX/XXXX of living XXXX. When I got my credit report I saw that all the time they cashed payment which to me is representative of a binding agreement they never protected my account. They reported lates ( several ) on my credit report and that of my stepson. My stepson was denied Federal employment and I am burdened with still maintaining him financially at some capacity due to the negative reporting by Navient. I even pleaded with them to release the co-signer and they refused. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to an attorney and I had to raise the money to file bankruptcy. It took me almost a year. I filed on XXXX XXXX and the loans were discharged on XXXX XXXX. The 5 months of bankruptcy the accounts were protected under the stay. I started paying again. I have asked Navient to correct my credit and they refuse. They have damaged my credit and my stepson though I acted in good faith. They are charging me and my stepson 6.25 % on XXXX of the loans when the cap for those deployed under SCRA is 6 %. They are refusing to adjust that as well. They were already sued by the Dept. of Justice for violations of the SCRA $ XXXX dollars. I am asking that my credit file and that of my co-signer be fixed since it is full of errors. They lie and are refusing to do so. I have filed complaints with other regulatory agencies. I am adamant when I say I want all files repaired to show the payments and deferrals that were made/granted. To date the loans have increased due to fees, late payments to a whopping {$15000.00} and {$6600.00} respectively. This is what reflects on my credit file. That is an increase of approximately {$5000.00} and {$2600.00} for the other. This is usurious and abusive. They are taking advantage on the situations of individuals and in the process also ruin their creditworthiness intentionally. They have no regard for agreements made on the phone with customer service.

Getting a credit card,"I received an unsolicited credit card from US Bank in the mail on XX/XX/2020. I made several attempts to contact US Bank by phone to complain and cancel the card.

After my daughter called 3 times for me, I was sent a letter on XX/XX/XXXX, about the unauthorized charges in XX/XX/XXXX. We sent that into Fortiva, no word yet. On each of my statements that have actually been sent, I am still paying cash advance interest charges. I have paid {$990.00} on this card since having received it in XXXX of XXXX. Every time I make a payment, around XXXX  goes to my balance, the rest just pays fees associated with my account. I am XXXX years old, and I am on social security. Only one or two times have I paid the minimum payment. If all I am going to pay is fees, I might as well not pay anything, because this card will never be paid off. I have cut the card up and  disposed of it. Fortiva keeps telling me that I am late on my payments, however they don't even send me statements to show me how much I owe. My daughter set the account up online, so she could see what is going on with it. In XXXX, the first statement has a due date of XXXX XXXX. I received the card in XXXX of XXXX. My agreement with them states that they will send me statements by mail, and they have not done so. I can only pay my bills with checks as I am not computer savy as my children are. For the 2020 year, there are only three statements listed, XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX 's statement it shows I am over the limit {$120.00}, and I haven't even used the card. It shows I have a past due balance of {$150.00}, and I have been sending them {$100.00} a month. They have charged me {$12.00} maintenance fee, and a {$40.00} past due fee, but the last statement I received before XXXX, XXXX, was XX/XX/XXXX statement.

I expect a stimulus check for maybe $ 1000- {$1200.00} but that would not be enough if I was hospitalized.

He has huge medical bills paying for my mom and she just had XXXX, plus debt of his own and hes been on 25 % reduced paycheck for over a year. He can not afford to pay it. Navient only offered to lower the payment from {$250.00} to {$120.00} per month for just a few months which I said I can not afford. 

Additionally, an XXXX XXXX I was applying for got put on hold so I cant even start that to gain experience to get a better paying job so that I can actually afford my bills and get out of debt.

Lost or stolen check,"Travelers Checks were bought in XXXX from XXXX and XXXX ( "" Bank '' ) and American Express Company ( "" AmEx '' ), relying upon promised reimbursement within XXXX hours of notice of lost/stolen checks. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I discovered {$1600.00} in checks were missing. XXXX different claim forms provided by AmEx for lost/stolen checks were submitted as directed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and repeatedly through XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, a third set of forms ( Travelers Cheque Refund Reimbursement Agreement and Terms & Conditions-Purchase Agreement ) sent by AmEx was returned ( by certified mail, email and fax ). There have been numerous emails, faxes, and letters, and conversations with XXXX AmEx and XXXX Bank agents. See Attachment XXXX Chronology ( summary of contacts ) and Attachments XXXX ( copies of all correspondence ). 

I was advised the checks had not been and likely could not be cashed as they are on high alert. AmEx supervisor XXXX ( office in XXXX ) stated in conversation memorialized in my cover letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that my XXXX claims were satisfactory and would be paid within 15 business days after AmEx received the third set of forms. AmEx received those forms, modified as discussed, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ; but they have not paid. 

Instead, they engaged in a modus operandi of deliberate continuing, repetitive pattern of unfair, deceptive, abusive and discriminatory practices designed to delay and defraud - similar to wide-spread reports in the news media and on the internet, affecting large numbers of buyers of AmEx services ( like Travelers ' Checks, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX or XXXX ), all seemingly supervised by the same agents/offices. See Attachment XXXX. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX subordinate, XXXX, telephoned to discuss the Reimbursement Agreement and Purchase Agreement. I had difficulty understanding his accent and asked him to send an email/letter specifying any problems and precise directions for remedy. No response has been received. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I demanded Bank reimburse, as promised in XXXX. I provided copies of the attached documents. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I spoke by phone with Bank Officer XXXX XXXX, who reported AmEx agent XXXX told her the problem was that the agreed-upon cross-out deletions on the forms were made with black ink pen and yellow highlighter ( as XXXX requested ), but AmEx did not want the black ink. 

This difference, without substantive distinction, raised integrity issues re AmEx confirming the intended deletions of : acknowledging failure to comply ; agreeing AmEx could not stop payment on checks ; releasing AmEx from all actions, liabilities, contracts ; waiving the right to challenge authenticated signatures ; paying all AmEx costs, expenses and attorneys fees ; waiving the right to jury trial ; agreeing to jurisdiction and venue in XXXX XXXX County, Utah ; and waiving any claims of lack of jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. The deletions also removed a purchase agreement sought by AmEx 20 years after purchase, reciting numerous matters not originally agreed to, seeming to be extortion by supposed fiduciaries to force a new contract of adhesion. 

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX superior XXXX XXXX, who said that Bank would find someone higher at AmEx in the United States, not XXXX, nor overseas, and "" escalate.

I waited the recommended 24 hours before trying to set up the online banking log in so that I could fund the account, I received multiple error messages here and was not allowed to enroll when using my account number and information to set up. The other option to enroll in online banking per the website was to enter your debit card number, I waited approximately a week to 10 days before receiving the debit card. I went online at that time to enroll in online banking and fund the account, again error messages and was not allowed to set up. The bank sent me a letter a few weeks after opening requesting that I mail them a copy of my social security card and proof of my residence with a bill in order to finalize opening my account and allow enrollment in online banking. I am absolutely not going to mail a copy of my social security number. I ignored the letter and gave up on attempting to fund or open this account, I started an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX instead.

I called customer service on XX/XX/2019 and spoke to the representative telling him the fact pattern above and requesting that he close the account, he responded that because it was an online account he couldn't close this out until I paid {$14.00} to bring the account to {$0.00} and then paid a {$50.00} early termination fee. I requested to speak with his manager. When I told the manager about the sequence of events above she said that because I had not mailed my social security card and proof of address they had not finalized opening my account, that is why I wasn't able to fund it or set up online banking. I asked her to close the account, she said she could not close the account because it had a negative balance of - {$14.00} which was the monthly maintenance fee and that there was an early termination fee as well of {$50.00}. I told her that I never funded the account, because they would not let me, I never spent a dollar or even activated the debit card, she said I would have to write a letter to her back office in order to close the account and that I would need to pay {$64.00}.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"Hello, I had a federal loan for {$10000.00}, last year I was going through a divorce and was n't working full time, just doing odds and ends to make money.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"First off, Because im not a borrower on the HELOC it was impossible to get information about the loan from SLS LLC I had to get my ex to write a letter or do a 3-way call SLS LLC is required to first obtain a court order establishing the liability for the debt and any ownership interest in the property and is barred from foreclosure by advertisement. Due to my divorce decree ( MICHIGAN ) SLS LLC failed to notify me of the mortgage assignment. SLS LLC failed to provide the me with the required written notifications and violated my rights under Michigan Law. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) is a federal law that requires certain disclosures to be provided to borrowers in connection with the transfer or sale of their mortgage. Specifically, RESPA requires that borrowers be provided with a notice of transfer of servicing rights when their mortgage is sold or assigned to a new servicer, including when the mortgage is assigned to a trust. RESPA requirements for notification of mortgage transfers to a trust : Timing of Notice : The notice of transfer of servicing rights must be provided to the borrower at least 15 days before the effective date of the transfer, unless the borrower receives the notice at or before the time of the transfer. 
Content of Notice : The notice of transfer of servicing rights must include the following information : 1. The effective date of the transfer of servicing rights 2. The name, address, and telephone number of the new servicer 3. A statement that the transfer of servicing rights does not affect any terms or conditions of the mortgage, except those directly related to the servicing of the loan.

4. A statement that the borrower has the right to continue to submit loan payments to the old servicer for up to 60 days after the effective date of the transfer, if the borrower sends payments to the old servicer by mistake. 
5. A statement that if the borrower has a dispute with the new servicer regarding the servicing of the loan, the borrower must submit a written request for information or notice of error to the new servicer 's designated address for such requests.

Method of Notice : The notice of transfer of servicing rights may be provided to the borrower by mail or electronically, if the borrower has consented to receive electronic communications.

SLS failed to respond to my written request for validation of debt this debt is 19 years old and is not reported on my credit report. 
SLS LLC failed to provide monthly statements, a notice of default with intent to collect, a loss mitigation application and any notification of reinstatement rights.

I received a written letter dated 2 days after the publication of foreclosure.

This happened XXXX, where the only notice I received was from a debt collector within a few days of being past due. Even after paying the balance, CHASE still reported negative XXXX days past due to all XXXX credit reporting agencies. This happened XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Have since gone to XXXX.com and setup accounts to send paper statements via XXXX and have not received them.

Unauthorized transactions/trans. issues,"On XX/XX/2017 I received an email from American Express that my Bluebird card denied a transaction due to insufficient funds. I accessed my account and found numerous unauthorized charges, both posted and pending. I called customer service and disputed the posted transactions and also notified them of the pending transactions that were fraudulent. My card was canceled and they started the process of sending a new one. 

On XX/XX/2017 I received an email indicating my disputes were declined and my account locked due to violating the membership agreement. At this point I was no longer able to access the account. I received more emails indicating the account had a negative balance, despite the fact there was a {$75.00} balance when I disputed the charges and the card canceled ( fees? ). Upon calling customer service again, there was no satisfaction, no explanation as to how it was determined the charges were valid or an explanation of which charges ( or all of them? ) were determined to be valid. 

The amount gone from my account is approximately {$2300.00}. Since I am unable to access the account, I do not have the ability to determine exactly how much money, what all the charges are and what the balance should be. 

As part of this resolution, I want a complete list of all the transactions on the account.",,2359883
Attempts to collect debt not owed,"American Express lie about the $ they say I owe them Back in XX/XX/XXXX they notified me that my regular loan payment had not been made. So they charged me a late fee of {$39.00}. In looking into this I saw that my automatic payment through my XXXX bank account, that I made every month since opening the loan, had for some reason not been accepted by American Express. 
Then I went through the record of my account and saw that they had also charged me a late fee in XXXX for a payment that was not made on time. And I never realized that until I looked it up and saw it. Neither of those late fees should have been charged to me because whatever the problem was in them not receiving payment was not my fault or my bank 's fault. It was some mistake that they made! 
So I tried calling them to discuss it and the person I got on the phone didn't even speak XXXX XXXX  I couldn't understand her and so I just hung up the phone. 
Then I searched their website and XXXX page and all the information I could find, to try to email them. And they don't offer or accept any emails! 
And I prefer email because it's documentable, whereas a phone conversation is just hearsay and I don't have the capability of recording a phone conversation. 
So because of all this inability to communicate with them I went over my account and what I owed them and saw how much I owed which was {$3300.00}, and from that I subtracted the two late payments amounting to {$78.00} and paid them the balance of money that I owed them, which by my accounting was {$3200.00}. XXXX pd. leaves a bal. of {$3300.00} minus {$78.00} for 2 late fees never credited = {$3200.00} owed and {$280.00} in interest paid. 
Ever since then, they have been billing me for XXXX XXXX XXXX. I forget the exact amount, and the illegal thing that they have been doing is that they have been calling me and not even leaving messages! They call and let my phone go to voicemail and then they don't say anything into the voicemail but the voicemail still registers as if it received a voicemail. So every day now for the past several months I've been getting these harassing calls without messages, XXXX per day, and I have blocked quite a few of the numbers that they have called me from, but it seems they have an unlimited amount of phone numbers they can use, because the blocking and reporting the numbers as spam, doesn't seem to stop them and that is why I'm sure this is illegal and harassment and should not be allowed! 

And, since writing this original complaint in XXXX and seeing if the credit unions could help ( which they didn't ) I got three different attempts on XXXX to get money from me from three different strangers. I also got an attempt on my XXXX bank account and my XXXX account from two other strangers making attempts to get money from me. 
This kind of thing has never happened to me before and I wonder if American Express, and or, some of their employees are behind these attempts, because they do have some information about my financial data? But I think I do keep most or all of my information pretty secure and protected with passwords etc. 

But with these attempts being made, it looks to me as though XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, would have gone through with paying these strangers my money without my knowledge, permission, or authorization! 
And I had to go through a lot of mumbo jumbo with them to tell them not to pay them! And this definitely is not fair or legal and if it is somehow legal then I can't believe that! 

So, if you can help me to put a stop to this, I would certainly appreciate it and appreciate my credit rating being restored back to what it was before they started all of this lying and deception, because my credit rating shouldn't have to suffer because of what they are doing.",,6347398
Struggling to pay mortgage,"CFPD, I am writing to file a formal complaint in regard to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing and the mishandling of my Loss Mitigation Application. By constantly changing the single point of contact ( SPOC ), Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing is not putting forth a Good Faith effort as required by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). 

A brief and condensed history follows. My hardship started in XXXX with the downturn of the economy. My former husbands XXXX business was put out of business which ultimately led to a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy filing XX/XX/XXXX. We began a XXXX-year Chapter XXXX Plan. Due to the stress and hardships our marriage ended XX/XX/XXXX. I then lost my job XX/XX/XXXX and struggled financially which all led to getting behind on our mortgage. I have lived in my home for 19 years and have worked tirelessly to try and save my home by applying for my mortgage to be modified through the Loss Mitigation process. 

Our first Mortgage Lender was XXXX. I submitted a Loss Mitigation Application starting in XXXX which was a completely abysmal process. Due to XXXX haphazard effort through XX/XX/XXXX, the application never resulted in a completed Modification outcome. Repeat issues of requesting more and more documents of information that had already been submitted and not acknowledged. Multiple changes of, single point of contact, in which each new person was starting over in the application process. I could not get any traction and finally retained our Chapter XXXX attorney to represent me in the Loss Mitigation process to XXXX mid-XXXX. My attorney also could not get clear communication with XXXX. Then all communications ceased XX/XX/XXXX ; later to find out the loan had been transferred to another servicer, XXXX, who held it until it was transferred to XXXX for approximately 6 months and ultimately ended with Shellpoint sometime in the XXXX of XXXX. 

I reached out and met with XXXX XXXX, Certified Housing Counselor at SNAP, on XX/XX/XXXX to once again begin a new Loss Mitigation Application with Shellpoint. At that appointment I came prepared with required documents to submit the Loss Mitigation Application including : Uniform Borrow Assistance Form, Homeowner Financial Worksheet, Copy of Divorce Order, Property Taxes and Homeowners Insurance Form, Doff-Frank Certification, Budget, Profit and Loss Statement, Copy of Mortgage Statements, 2 most recent bank statements, 30 days of pay stubs, last 2 yrs IRS Tax Returns, a monthly utility bill, copies of all household bills and a Hardship Letter signed and dated which XXXX XXXX submitted to Shellpoint. 

I have previously completed and submitted all requested documents, however I continue to get notifications saying they are missing requested documents that have already been sent and confirmed they were received by XXXX XXXX who was the 2nd SPOC. They are using these tactics to say they havent received documents to close my file by saying it is incomplete and they may conclude that you have withdrawn your request for a loss mitigation program and may resume other means to collect any amounts due on your account. Furthermore, I made every accommodation for a local Broker to come to my home for a BPO report requested by Shellpoint mid-XXXX XXXX. I was waiting to hear back from Shellpoint as to my options for Loss Mitigation when I noticed a man on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX taping a Notice of Default to my front door! I scanned the document and emailed it to XXXX XXXX who then contacted Shellpoing the next morning. She was informed my single point of contact was no longer XXXX XXXX, the person I had been corresponding with for approximately 2 months, and was now XXXX XXXX, who she spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX. However I never received any notification of a change. I contacted XXXX XXXX via email on XX/XX/XXXX and she informed me via email on XX/XX/XXXX that she in fact was NOT the single point of contact and that XXXX XXXX was. Again, I was NOT notified of any change. I finally received notification of the change, but not until after I notified them via email I had not received any notification. 

I have had 4 different single points of contact with Shellpoint since I started the Loss Mitigation process! Another point to note, is XXXX XXXX was told by XXXX XXXX that I would need to pay a 25 % down payment of {$75000.00} before being considered for a Loan Modification. This was the first Id ever heard of it and currently have not seen anything in regard to a down payment requirement. The requirement of a down payment is ludicrous and, by no means, a Good Faith Effort! If I had {$75000.00} I would not be applying for a modification of my mortgage. I have also come across information and public records that Shellpoint has been found at fault/guilty in the Court of Law for these same practices against homeowners. Shlepping continues to exhibit patterns of predatory practices on people trying to retain their homes. As such, they should be held accountable for their actions. There are clear violations in accordance with the CFPB rules and the Dodd-Frank Act. 

I am following advise given by XXXX XXXX by filing this complaint and ask for your assistance in this matter. I know there are hundreds of thousands of homeowners who have been in the same shoes as I and have lost their homes due to the strong arming of large mortgage companies who have not put forth a Good Faith effort in helping homeowners save their homes with affordable options. I hope not to become a statistic.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,3176482

Can't stop charges to bank account,"Requested original lender ( XXXX ) to stop drafting funds from my account at the end of XXXX XXXX, as I lost my job and I wanted to create a payment arrangement. They said they could n't do anything until I missed a payment. I called my bank who placed a stop payment for anything being withdrawn by XXXX. I thought I had paid this bill in early XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I was contacted by First American Solutions LLC and told I owed money for this dept. I stated that I did n't have the money to pay this and that I was n't sure it was my debt ( again I thought I had paid it ). I asked for proof they said they would send it. I also asked if I agreed to pay a smaller amount ( XXXX ) in two weeks to just make it go away if they could work with me. They said to call back but until I could call back to avoid the processor ( whom never came ) and on XXXX XXXX ( 4 days after I spoke with someone ) they drafted XXXX from my bank account. Without authorization. I had my bank immediately reverse the charge. I have proof of this withdrawl in the form of a copy of the electronic check submitted to my bank. 

I also sent a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX requesting proof of this debt or removal of this item from my credit report and for them to cease and disist contacting me regarding this debt if they could not or would not provide me with the information requested. ( I have a copy of the letter but have moved and it 's boxed up someplace ). 

They also contacted me around XXXX of XXXX as well but I did not answer and never received anything from the "" Processor '' that threatened to stop by my house or place of business ( I work from home so if they came by I would know ) Last week I received a call from First American Solutions LLC again requesting payment I told them everything that happened two years ago and about the letter I sent in XXXX. The mans response to me was something along the lines of we would n't withdraw money from your account we do n't do that but if we did it 's perfectly legal. He also stated they sent proof 2 years ago, I said I did n't receive it and requested the information again and even gave him my email address. I have not received anything via email or mail since he contacted me mid last week.",,1498728

Billing disputes,"American Express has no way to receive written messages through its website, other than, perhaps, in a "" chat '' exchange that is far too time consuming to be worthwhile. It will not allow you to simply send a written message to it through its website.

Its online questionnaire to challenge unauthorized charges, furthermore, tries to force you to answer inaccurate questions, the presuppositions of which are simply false. It tries to box you into statements you would not make by its refusal to take written comments from its customers online that are in the customer 's words rather than in AMEX 's.

Managing the loan or lease,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I'm reaching out because I was sold a lemon and need help. 

I purchased a used truck through XXXX XXXX XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later on XX/XX/XXXX the truck broke down while I was driving, I was commuting from work back home. The truck suddenly died without warning while I was driving. I immediately contacted the dealer to ask for help. They referred me to a Tow Truck service but they did not offer to cover the cost. They asked that I have the truck towed to the car lot and said one of their mechanics would inspect the vehicle. The cost for the tow was {$110.00}, I'm including the receipt in this email. 

When I arrived at the dealership, I met with the owner and explained how disappointed and deceived I felt. I had discovered a discrepancy ; the mileage that was written down on the loan paper was incorrect. The dealer admitted that they wrote the trip mileage down and not the real mileage. The owner of the dealership agreed to have the truck repaired and to cover the cost. He asked that I leave the truck overnight so the next day his mechanic could inspect it and repair it. The next day I was unable to commute to work due to this. I work in construction and do not get paid for time off, if I don't work, I don't get paid. Not only did I have to pay the tow truck but I lost a day of work which means my paycheck was short. The next day I picked up the truck late in the evening and was told the transmission had been flushed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the change oil warning came on so I decided to take the truck for an oil change at a XXXX dealership and to inquire about a transmission evaluation for a peace of mind. I took the truck to XXXX XXXX, they did an oil change, I have attached the receipt from XXXX XXXX for {$60.00}, they informed me a transmission diagnostic check would be around {$400.00}. I decided to look for a more affordable option. In the mean time I decided to get a roadside assistance membership with XXXX because I felt uneasy about this vehicle. 

Yesterday XX/XX/XXXX the truck broke down again while I was driving to work. Once again, I called the dealership to speak to the owner to make him aware. This time he offered to have the truck towed, he personally arrived in a tow truck and towed the truck to my residence. We discussed my options and he said the best thing to do would be to get an extended warranty on the vehicle and have the warranty company rebuild the transmission. He offered to make my first loan payment so that I could afford to make a first payment towards an extended warranty. However, he did make it clear that this would be as far as he would go to help. He stated he could not offer more than that but he was very adamite about making my first payment so that I can get extended warranty. I felt pressured and told him I needed time to explore my options. 

Today XX/XX/XXXX I had to miss work once again because I don't have a vehicle to commute, once again my paycheck will be short this week due to this truck. Instead of making money I had to get the truck to another auto shop to get a transmission evaluation that you the lender have requested. The cost for the transmission diagnostic was {$88.00}. The auto shop determined that the truck needs the transmission rebuilt. Please reference the notes on the attached receipt. I was quoted {$4000.00} to have the transmission rebuild. 

Since I purchased the truck, 2 weeks ago, I have spent ; {$1500.00} down payment {$300.00} insurance {$110.00} tow truck {$60.00} oil change {$9.00} XXXX  membership {$88.00} transmission evaluation {$800.00} missed work Since purchasing this vehicle, I lost {$2000.00} not including lost income due to missed days at work. I have my first payment of {$420.00}, plus insurance {$140.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. So, after the first month of purchase, I will have spent {$3000.00} altogether. My job requires a vehicle, I can not work without a vehicle. I currently don't have transportation. I feel deceived and I am very frustrated. It is clear that I was sold a lemon for almost $ XXXX. 

I sent all this to the finance company XXXX XXXX and they denied my claim because they said it was pass the XXXX miles but the dealer put the wrong miles and they said they couldnt do anything about it but I had not paid my first payment yet it broke down a week and it needs a new transmission before I make my first payment and the finance company would not allow me to return it even though they easily could have.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,4295126

I then sent them {$27.00} the following month towards a {$120.00} bill ( I had not realised that they sent me a collection fee of {$18.00} and did not understand why the bill was different but thought it was just the last reading ). The name of the collection agency is Convergent and I have contacted them because their bill states {$130.00}. At this time, I do not have the account # for Convergent, but do have the XXXX account # XXXX for which I have paid {$42.00} of the {$120.00}.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I was searching for a personal loan to help me consolidate my credit card debt. I received an approval from One Main Financial. When the representative contacted me, we discussed how I had planned to use my funds and reassured me that this would be a great loan and would help me out. Initially, I was looking for a {$15000.00} loan, but she convinced me that they could give me a larger loan amount and I could pay off my car and have extra cash for emergency needs. She said that they would have to keep my car as collateral and it would be a secured loan. At that time, I believe I only owed, {$8000.00} on my car. She said that it would be a five-year-loan. 

When I went into the office to sign the documents, the loan agreement showed an APR of 26.94 % .The amount financed was {$26000.00}. My monthly payments would be {$810.00} per month over a five-year-period. I noticed that very little was being applied to my principal ( averaging about {$11.00} per month ) and the remainder was going to interest. I contacted XXXX from One Main inquiring why was so little being applied to my principal ; she said, the first couple of years, most of the interest is paid off and later more money would be applied to the principal. Well, needless to say, I now have had this loan for nearly four years as of XX/XX/XXXX, and the interest is still at an unbelievably high interest rate. A couple months ago, I had to double up on my payment, because I got behind. I paid over {$1600.00} and only {$4.00} was applied to the principal! I started downloading my monthly statements, and noticed that this company has been ripping me off for years. As of today, my balance is {$21000.00}. Apparently, I have 15 months to pay off the loan, which is not going to happen, according to their exorbitant interest rates and predatory lending practices, because as of today, I only paid off {$5300.00}. 

When the pandemic hit, I got behind with my payments, because I had a XXXX XXXX, and had to quit my part-time job. I'm XXXX and on a fixed income and had been struggling financially, so every day that you're late, they charge {$15.00} per day, which has happened to me on numerous occasions, so my monthly payment averages over {$900.00}.

I had contacted One Main and they had put me on a deferred payment plan, which made matters worse, because the "" interest '' is still accumulating. I called One Main to see what they could do to help me with this and explained to them my situation. They said that I could apply for another loan and get {$190.00} back, but I would be back on a "" five-year-loan. '' I told them, this loan has done nothing, but created a huge headache for me, no, Thank You!!! They make these loans difficult to pay back. You will never pay them off due to their deceptive loan practices. I have paid nearly {$40000.00} as of today, mostly in interest. This is insane!!! Somebody has to shut this company down. They have been harassing me constantly through various phone numbers. Once I'm late, they will call from ten different phone numbers every day, including Saturdays, but don't leave messages. I need help!!! I had no idea that this company would create so much stress and XXXX to me.",,7089492
"Managing, opening, or closing account","I have a Rushcard account, which I opened XX/XX/2015. I have been adding funds to the card without any issues, However, on XXXX XXXX, 2015, I added a total of {$1000.00} to the card XXXX XXXX separate transactions of {$500.00} each ). There is no record of the the reload that I made on XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, I added another {$500.00} to the card, which is also not being reflected when I call Rushcard 's card services automated line. I called the company on XXXX XXXX and was able to speak with a representative who told me that they were updating their systems and that the system would be working by XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX. I checked my balance again on XXXX XXXX, and my balance was still XXXX. I called Rushcard again and spoke with a representative who asked me for all of the numbers on the receipt, including a transaction number. Once I read every number on the receipt, I was informed that none of those numbers were recognized by their system. She then told me to go back to the retail outlet where I reloaded the card to ask them for the transaction number, I did and was told by the store manager that the numbers on the receipt should suffice for Rushcard to identify my reload. I called Rushcard again on XXXX XXXX and told the representative what the store manager said, and at that time the representative told me that she would escalate my complaint. Since XXXX, I have not received a response from Rushcard, and to make matters worse, I have called card services at Rushcard at least 30 times since then. When I press "" XXXX '' for a representative, the phone rings once or twice and then I am disconnected. The automated system is still reflecting a XXXX balance on my account.",,1618783
Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"I regret to have to do this, but it pains me to notify you of some rude behavior of a supervisor over the phone. I have had payday loans for a long time with no issues overall from Moneytree. I only had one other time they had to reverse a fee because I was given incorrect information from another Moneytree representative over the phone. I have gotten increases in my available loan amounts, which shows I have excellent history.

And yet, because ONE check was sent to my bank and got returned, which caused me a {$25.00} NSF fee from my bank, the manager only came off that it was all my fault and that she refused to call my bank on a three way call as a COMMON COURTESY to explain that this was an unforeseen error. I never received the text message I normally get as a reminder of any due date, and had I gotten that message, I would have called right away to change my due date to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I never get upset, but this manager got me very upset. She was rude and refused to serve the customer in a common capacity by representing that customer to the bank explaining what happened. This is because the banks often want to hear from the company the reason for the returned check. And the only reason why they sent the ACH is because they did not receive a payment or call by the due date of XX/XX/XXXX, which is a new due date for me to begin with. Normally my due date is around the XXXX of each month. 

People are people. They make mistakes. They forget. They get busy. But as you will see from my excellent history with XXXX, there was NO reason why this had to happen to me. And it is a fact she admitted there was no policy or law preventing her from doing a three-way call to my bank. So, in essence, she REFUSED SERVICE in a common and respectful manner, causing me to get very frustrated with her. I think we are all adults I explained, and there is no reason for me to be treated in this manner. 

I am thinking seriously about never using their services again after I pay off this loan, unless this is resolved, and she is talked to about this behavior. I felt more than insulted and disrespected by her, and I said Im the customer, and I have been doing payday loans and other services with your company for a very long time. There is no reason for this counter-productive and negative treatment to me. I can not repeat that enough. 

People in corporations and business should never be allowed to get away with this. The customer is always right, especially when things like this happen to us. This took place today, XX/XX/2020, about XXXX XXXX   mountain time. I had called into the phone number XXXX, but my situation required the representative who answered the phone to transfer me to the payment center, and then from there the representative had me to talk to her manager. You have to get the names from your research.

I expect something in support for me to be done about this. She can wave all the fees she wants. That does not excuse her behavior, and also the refusal to honor my request to explain to my bank what happened, so the bank has a reason from an actual company over the phone. I have already sent the request to my credit union to reverse the NSF fee, in addition to this situation. 

I am a genuine and kind person, but any normal person would feel this way if they are treated in the manner I was. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.

"" The facts of this case are as follows : WESTERN UNION WAS SENT sent money orders through Western Union, but Western Union failed to return them in a timely manner. The student then sent money order request order forms for each money order, but Western Union failed to respond to these forms in a timely manner, and when they did respond, their response was inaccurate. 

The relevant regulations in this case are the Electronic Funds Transfer Act ( EFTA ) and the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ). The EFTA requires financial institutions to provide consumers with access to their account information and to correct errors in their accounts. The UCC governs commercial transactions, including the sale of money orders. 

Western Union has violated the EFTA by failing to provide the student with access to their account information and by failing to correct the errors in their account. Western Union has also violated the UCC by failing to deliver the money orders to XXXX XXXX XXXX and by providing inaccurate information to the student. 

The consequences for failure of due process HAS BEEN AND STILL IS severe.. In this case, be able to recover the money that they lost, as well as damages for their emotional distress. I'm able to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), which can investigate Western Union and take enforcement action.

The court ordered Western Union to pay the plaintiff {$10000.00} in damages.

Fraud or scam,"To whom it may concern : I am writing to share my story of a XXXX fraud scam. I have been a Bank of America client for 20 years, and have come to trust the bank 's marketing of consumer fraud protection. I was told by my bank that XXXX was a safe tool for money transfers. I was scammed by a fraudster who took advantage of this trust, and who knew that both Bank of America and XXXX ( a product of XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) would have opportunities to prevent or reverse the scam but would repeatedly fail to do so. Specifically : 1. Bank of America as a whole bank brand advertises fraud protection constantly. As a customer, my expectation has been repeatedly set that Bank of America products come with fraud protection, and yet they have built a service ( XXXX ) into their online banking and mobile banking apps that comes with XXXX protection for consumers. 
2. Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX make insufficient effort to warn account holders of this lack of protection. It wasn't clear to me until I was scammed that I would have absolutely no recourse, yet Bank of America customer service all but laughed in my face when I asked if they could help recover my funds. 
3. Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX apparently make no use of their data to detect what should have been clearly fraudulent activity on my account : First, multiple declined transfer requests should have prompted an account lockdown. Second, a third-party link should not have the ability to directly confirm a transfer. Third, it should have been obvious from my account history and/or from the activity of the fraudster 's account that this was a suspicious transfer, yet no special authorization was required to drain my account of nearly its entire balance. 

My expectation as a customer of the bank is that I will be protected from fraudulent activity. The bank advertises and promotes fraud protection constantly, but now that I have been a victim of fraud, consumer protections are nowhere to be found from either Bank of America or XXXX XXXX XXXX. This deception and failure of responsibility from my bank feels in many ways like an even worse violation than the scam itself. 

On Monday evening XX/XX/XXXX I received a call which showed as "" BOA '' on my caller ID. I then received a text and then another phone call from the same party. Believing I was being contacted by my bank, I answered the call. The caller addressed himself as "" XXXX XXXX, ID number XXXX. '' He informed me that someone had made a fraudulent {$3500.00} XXXX transfer from my Bank of America personal checking account. He kept saying he was checking a few things out because there was a high volume of fraudulent attempts - I was seeing these transfer requests and declining them on my end, which corroborated his story. He then said, "" let 's try one more thing, '' texted me a link, and instructed me on the phone call to click the link to complete a "" test '' on my account. I clicked the link, which was in fact a link to confirm the transfer request. This was the first violation, where Bank of America and XXXX XXXX XXXX inexplicably have allowed a link sent by a third party to point customers to confirm a transfer request. It seems obvious to me that I should have to go directly to my online banking account or app to do something like this. 

I received a text message saying thank you for your confirmation on this transfer. I immediately panicked ; the fraudster on the other end of the phone actually giggled. He told me that because it was after bank hours I would have to wait until morning for the "" test '' to be reversed. When I awoke, I called Bank of America directly and told a customer service agent what had happened. I was clearly in a state of panic but the agent lacked any empathy, saying only that I had been scammed and that I need to make a claim with the fraud department. The fraud department was so busy that they had to call me back - and when they did, I was already at a local Bank of America branch seeking any assistance they might be able to provide. All Bank of America 's representatives could tell me is that they would "" not likely '' be able to protect me or reclaim my lost funds. 

Having been abandoned by Bank of America, and knowing the fraudulent transfer was completed via XXXX, I decided to contact XXXX directly. Of course Bank of America and the XXXX user interface intentionally obfuscate the fact that XXXX is run by a company called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, '' something I would not learn until much later. All I could do to find XXXX contact information was to search XXXX. I called the phone number that I found, and I was pleased to reach a live person, who identified himself as "" XXXX. '' I explained the situation and he told me not to worry - he had the power to help, and that there would be a few steps to begin the process. First, he had me install XXXX ( a screen sharing app ) so that he could record our interaction for his management to review. With my screen being shared to XXXX, he had me sign into my checking account and go to XXXX to do a test transfer for {$220.00}. At this point I have already exceeded my max in XXXX transfers from the prior scam. Seeing this, XXXX sent me a text and said he will be in touch once he is able to review my case with his superiors. He collected my email address, had me log out of Bank of America and all social media accounts while he watched my screen, and told me that my device had been hacked and that I was being monitored from multiple locations before we ended the call. 

Feeling suspicious and beginning to sense that something was wrong, I used a family member 's phone to try contacting XXXX again - this time, finding a different phone number, I reached an automated system. It became apparent that this was the actual contact for the XXXX operators, and that the human I had reached earlier was in fact another fraudster. I was sick to my stomach, realizing that Bank of America had yet again failed to give me the information I needed to know who operates XXXX or how to get in contact with them. When I learned about XXXX XXXX XXXX I was even more disappointed- why was I able to reach a FRAUDULENT customer service agent so easily, yet calling the real XXXX provider only got me to a brick wall of an automated system? 

I have closed my accounts, changed all of my passwords, enrolled in personal credit monitoring services at my own expense, and updated billing information at all the places I had my Bank of America card on file. The process has only begun for me to earn back the money I've lost. What may take even longer is the process for me to heal the psychological wound that this has left behind. I hope that this letter helps to inform other consumers, the regulatory authorities, banks offering XXXX to their customers, and XXXX XXXX XXXX of the very real fraud risk being willfully left open right now. I only feel fortunate that I am young enough to recover financially ; I can't imagine how this wide-open fraud opportunity is impacting the elderly and other vulnerable individuals who have been deceived into trusting their bank.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"I am writing to file a formal complaint on loan servicer, Navient. This complaint is based on Navients inability to provide me with correct information with my student loan and the lack of customer service that I received via phone. This complaint could be divided into the following topics : Consistency, Disclosing Information, and Customer Service. This complaint reflects Navients negligence in providing me with adequate loan servicing which could be looked as unfair and deceptive. Consistency : Over the course of three months, I have been told inconsistent and wrong information in regards to my repayment options. The first time I called Navient, the representative stated that I was ineligible to consolidate my loan or apply for any loan forgiveness plans based on the amount of my income. The representative also told me that the loan could not be refinanced being that the loan is a federal loan. I later researched and found out this was untrue. The second time I called, the representative told me that I actually could consolidate my loan and that once she entered in my information ( income of $ XXXX/year and a family of XXXX ), she then told me that I would be qualified for loan forgiveness this year and that my monthly payment amount would be {$0.00}. She instructed me to complete an application from U.S Department of Education to finalize the process. A couple of weeks after I completed the application, I received a notification that my monthly payments would be {$220.00} for twelve months. After receiving the email notification, I called Navient and was told that the previous reps have told me the wrong information and that I am on the lowest payment plan. Due to Navients pattern of providing me inconsistent and wrong information, I have lost trust with the company. Disclosing Information : I have asked over 3 Navient representatives for an amortization schedule. All of the reps have informed me that the company does not provide amortizations schedules. I have also ask a manager to send me information in regards to how much of my loan will be forgiven based off my loan consolidation. I have yet to receive any information. As a consumer understanding how each payment is allocated is important to me. I am unknowledgeable of how my payments are truly allocated due to Navients inability to provide me with my loan information Customer Service : Due to the lack of knowledge from the representatives from Navients call center, most of my calls have been escalated to upper management. I have been told from 2 managers that I would have my account reviewed and that I would be receiving a follow-up call. I have never received a call back from anyone from Navient.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I was told when I agreed to the loan that I could make extra payments at any time to be applied to principal only. I did so, but in fact the detailed records of transactions showed delays in processing, application of consequent late fees and transaction charges. When I paid only the amount owed it worked without a hitch so I gave up trying to save by paying off principal faster. Now I have wrecked the car and am paying off total and I asked for an audit.

Managing an account,"On XX/XX/21, I opened a Fifth Third Momentum Checking account online ( ending in XXXX ) and was provided with the account opening disclosures. I also created my online banking account at the same time. In all of the disclosures that were provided to me at account opening and when I created my online banking, Fifth Third did not disclose to me that there was a {$3.00} web transfer fee for making a transfer from online banking to an external account. On XX/XX/21, I initiated a {$2000.00} transfer to an external account. I later learned when reviewing my statement that Fifth Third charged me a {$3.00} web transfer fee. This fee was not disclosed to me on the screen prior to making the transfer either. Fifth Third advertises this checking account as "" No Hidden Fees '', but this {$3.00} web transfer fee appears to be a fee that was not disclosed prior to when it was charged and is therefore a hidden fee. This type of fee would be a fee that is required to be disclosed prior to account opening or prior to when the first EFT is completed under Regulation E. To make sure I didn't miss this fee at account opening, I reviewed the fee disclosure that is located on the Fifth Third website and again noted that this fee is not listed. I also could not locate a separate online banking fee schedule on the website or when logged into online banking. I have since closed out my account, as I did not see value in keeping the account open and was not happy with these hidden fees.",,4981064

They then said it wasn't closed yet but would be and there's nothing I could do even though I was in contact with them and attempting to resolve it. I explained this would hurt my credit and I would suffer financial hardship from this. They explained it would hurt my credit less if I closed the account voluntarily. This also was a red flag. I have no balance on the card n they accepted no less than 4 payments in the time frame of said 42 days.

I certainly would do this in order to GET those Bonus Points.
I know my credit score is very high (  XXXX  ) and I owe very little money. I could afford to pay it all off if I chose to do so.

Fraud or scam,"I met an individual over XXXX back in XXXX of XXXX. About a month later they indicated they were deployed to the XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, is the info they provided ). Initially XXXX XXXX asked me for money to help get him home as he was sick and they wouldn't send him home, however, I said no. Later on XXXX XXXX had asked me to assist him with his business investments as he was not able to access his bank account or bitcoin wallets over in XXXX. XXXX XXXX would have money sent to me through various means, wire transfer, cash and checks. Back in XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX had a "" business partner '' send me a check for deposit with the expectation the funds would be used for bitcoin investment. The bank flagged the check as fraud, at that point I decided it was best to stop speaking with XXXX XXXX. A few weeks later XXXX XXXX contacted me through a different number and winded up talking his way back in. I am a very trusting person and wanted to believe he was telling me the truth. He told me he loved me, quickly told me he wanted to get married, would ask about my son, would tell me that everything would work out when he returned from deployment but they continued to extend his deployment. He would have flowers sent to me, to keep his hold on my heart. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to log into my account with Navy Federal and was unable to. When I called them they said the wire transfer I received was flagged by the issuing institution ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  ) as a fraudulent transfer. They then told me it looked like I was laundering money because as soon as it hit my account I transferred the money out of my account. The transfer was for {$5000.00}. I transferred {$2000.00} through XXXX XXXX and {$2600.00} through XXXX via XXXX for bitcoin transfer. The individual who supposedly made the transfer into my account was XXXX XXXX 's business partner. When I decided on XXXX to cut ties with XXXX XXXX the business partner "" XXXX XXXX '' called me, pleading with me for over 30 minutes to work things out with XXXX XXXX, his mom is the one who made the transfer, and she made an additional transfer in the same day by accident, she called XXXX XXXX bank to report it and they posted it it as fraud to the wire transfer to my account. This is not the first time money had been transferred into my account for the purpose of bitcoin investments. Navy Federal is basically stating it is my fault as they warned me that it was fraud a few months ago and there is a hold/restriction on my account and I am out almost {$6000.00}. I am a single mom with full custody and can't afford to be out that kind of money. XXXX XXXX would sweet talk his way back into me letting him back in and assisting him with his business transactions. I assumed that because he wasn't asking me for money that I wasn't doing anything wrong. Navy Federal is placing me under investigation for fraud. I did not think I was doing anything wrong as I wanted to believe the fraudulent check was truly a mistake and wanted to be able to help him with his business transactions. I provided all supporting documentation to Navy Federal. Every time I call to talk to someone at Navy Federal I get a different response. Last week I was told by XXXX individual to submit an appeal and provide all supporting documentation which I did. The next person I spoke with then told me I should have never been told that, the person was new and didn't know what they were talking about. She then indicated to me that they would put a hold on my account for {$5000.00} which was requested to be returned from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  and the remainder of the funds would be released to be but I wouldn't be able to continue to bank with them. Today when calling to check the status, I was then told that they have a full restriction on my account and none of the funds are available to me as they are investigating all transfers into my account.

Delinquent account,"Payments made are put on hold needlessly every time. I am told the "" system '' is doing it and there is nothing I can do about it or anyone else. Payments made in cash from USAA banking to USAA credit card should not take up to but not limited to 21 days to be released. 

This is unacceptable for any company to receive their payments how can it be legal for them to withhold payments on the same token. If I were to withhold my payment I would be subject to a late fee and a interest fee. Yet I have to give you access to my funds for up to but not limited to 21 days. While having XXXX access to funds paid for in cash that have been received. 

I have been told this is due to my account being late in the past I am willing to accept this. I am willing to pay my balance off. I am willing to pay more than the balance, if it means I have access to my funds in up too but not limited to 3 days which I am told is the normal hold time. Yet ALL CUSTOMERS ARE SUBJECT TO A PAYMENT HOLD WITHOUT ANY REASON. 

I call to ask about when my funds will be available and I get harassed and discriminated due to my financial history despite offering to pay the balance in full or in any accommodating payment schedule. 

I am trying to pay USAA and I am met with prejudice, harassment, and discrimination. I am trying to pay my USAA insurance with my USAA credit card and they are telling me, that is subject to holds as well. I do n't have the option of going into a branch locally here In Oklahoma XXXX. The holds do nothing but make life harder for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and XXXX forbid you are trying to come out of the hole too. Then you are just meet with more discrimination and told well the system discriminates everyone so its ok. 

Normal working Americans can not get a paycheck on Friday and wait till the next pay check to have access to the first paycheck. 

After reading several consumer reports reviews I see now the problem is much bigger than me and potentially affecting many customers with USAA I encourage all of you to come forth and write about your experiences. What is happening is not right. How can working families pay their credit card payments and other bills while subject to holds that last on a regular basis XXXX21 days. 

If USAA can not offer a way to make a direct payment to them without holds this needs to be fully disclosed before signing agreements. I doubt this is clear to anyone that signs the credit card agreement. 

I will gladly pay off the remaining balance and never look back after reading other peoples accounts of USAA handling business. I now see the monster I have agreed keep my hard earned money with. I will be making arrangements to work with a local credit union, I can not believe this is acceptable in todays day and age. 

I know USAA had an issue with fraud in 2015 and prior its not my fault they did not have practices in place to protect them or their customers and I am done paying for the mistakes of my past and refuse to pay for the mistakes of USAA. This is disrespectful to me as a citizen that has never tried to defraud USAA to subject me to the same actions of Identity Fraud and credit card thieves. I will gladly pay triple my interest rate to deal with a company that can do business with full discloser and respect. 

Not to mention you guys have put my fico score through XXXX because of your inability to receive payments in a timely fashion. 

For example my first premier credit card is able to do all the things you are not and is not destroying my credit. It is the decision of USAA to do business this way and not industry standard.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,1811528

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I had a line of credit with Regions bank. I rarely accessed my checking, savings, credit card and line of credit. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I paid the full balance of {$4400.00} on the accounts and requested that the line of credit and credit card be closed. On XX/XX/XXXX Regions placed at {$47.00} maintenance fee on an account that was supposed to be closed. The fee then turned in {$190.00} because there were no notifications sent via email, mail or phone. I had this account for more than 5 years it shows that the fees were always taken from the checking account. During this period there was roughly {$24000.00} in the checking account.

When I purchased my house in XXXX I was notified of this on my report from XX/XX/XXXX then again on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. After contacting Regions 100s of times about this matter I finally got a rep named XXXX that said this was wrong and he would work to get the reports corrected. After about 60 days the reports updated and the negative lines were removed. There was a delay in my house closing which caused them the run my credit report again the day before closing and the negative lines were placed back on my report.

They will say sure we are closing it now then it remains open. I can not keep loosing sleep in fear that a service fee is going to show up on my credit report.

Closing an account,"Good afternoon, When I opened a 3rd Credit Builder savings account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was unaware that the funds would not be able to be added to the current secured credit card that I have with the company in order to increase my spending allowance and further assist with my credit building. I was able to do so once before after the initial setup of the credit card from my first savings account. When I read that there was a limit to the amount that I could have for the secured credit card limit, I requested to close the Credit Builder savings account and requested that the funds be returned. 

I read all of the information on the app and website regarding closing the savings account early. I followed those steps and closed the account on XX/XX/XXXX. I received an email from Self Financial, Inc. on XX/XX/XXXX stating that he account was closed successfully and that I would receive the {$860.00} funds that I paid to them on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Self stating that my account was under review and that they would close the account if I did not provide them with a wealth of very personal information that would put me in extreme jeopardy for identity theft. The email requested the following documents, none of which I had to provide when I opened the account ( besides my SSN for them to do a credit check ). 

State Issued Identification Card Social Security Card Picture of Customer Holding ID Bank Statement ending in XXXX Bank Statement ending in XXXX Bank Statement ending in XXXX My first thought is that this was a hoax because I had never had a credit card company ask me for my bank statements. Secondly, I thought the account that they were referencing was the still open secured credit card account. I did not think the review and potential closure had anything to do with the "" already '' closed Credit Builder savings account for which I had the email indicating it was already closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called Self Customer Service to get a better understanding. I was informed by Customer Service that I would need to provide all of the requested documents from the email. I sent an email to "" XXXX '' and to "" XXXX '' to no avail. They both stated that I would need to provide all of the requested documents because the account was under review. 

I could not imagine that a credit card company would put me in jeopardy of identity theft by asking for all of my information when they already had my SS number and credit report, along with my rent and utility bills information. I did provide them a copy of my drivers license. I contacted customer service again after providing the picture ID. I was told that Self still needed all of those documents and even if I decided to let the account just close, I would still not be able to receive my money back until l provided the documents. 

After reading their requirements again, I noticed that it did state on their website that they could legally ask for more information to verify an account. However, it did not specify that they would ask for personal documents such as all of my bank statements. If I provided this information to them along with my SS card and picture ID, what is stopping them from wiping out all of my accounts.",,6764338

( This amount was in fact withdrawn from my account on XX/XX/XXXX ). I submitted my annual re-certification for my IBR to the Department of Education on XX/XX/XXXX, as instructed by XXXX/the Department of Education because FedLoan Services never indicated that I needed to re-certify by a different date. In fact, they never specified any date in which I needed to re-certify, but indicated in the XX/XX/XXXX communication that I needed to do so by XX/XX/XXXX or my payments would increase. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification from FedLoan Servicing stating : "" We recalculated your monthly payment for your Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ) plan. We used your income documentation and family size to determine your monthly payment of {$680.00} which is first due on XX/XX/XXXX. Your new monthly payment amount is effective for all payments due between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. You are still responsible for any payments due before XX/XX/XXXX. About 3 months prior to XX/XX/XXXX, we will send you notification letting you know that you are due to recertify ( complete a new application and provide updated income documentation ). '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email informing me that FedLoan Servicing would be withdrawing {$2500.00} out of my bank account for my XX/XX/XXXXstudent loan payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Last year, I was told by XXXX that I needed to re-certify within ten days of XX/XX/XXXX. After re-certifying, my new monthly payments began on XX/XX/XXXX. Thus, my current IBR payment plan was not set to expire until XX/XX/XXXX. Given the fact that : ( 1 ) I timely filed my re-certification documentation on XX/XX/XXXX ; ( 2 ) my annual IBR re-certification amount had already been processed ( given that FedLoan Servicing 's XX/XX/XXXX communication informing me that my new monthly payment to be {$680.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) ; ( 3 ) FedLoan provided me with conflicting amounts concerning what I owed for the month of XX/XX/XXXX ; and ( 4 ) my current IBR payments were not set to expire until XX/XX/XXXX, I called FedLoan Servicing in an attempt to understand why they were charging me {$2500.00}. They told me that they would look into it and get back to me, and that I should forebear for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and incur additional interest or pay the full {$2500.00} amount. I declined to do so, and paid the {$680.00} for the month, given that is what my new adjusted IBR payment was determined to be earlier that month, and there was no valid reason to charge me {$2500.00} when I complied with the XXXX annual re-certification deadline that was given to me and technically my old IBR payments had not expired. In fact, it is clear from FedLoan Servicing 's confusing and contradictory communications that the organization simply made an error in processing my re-certification paperwork and determining how much I owed for XX/XX/XXXX. When I spoke to FedLoan Servicing, they said it would take several months to resolve my complaint, a supervisor told me it was my fault that I was charged {$2500.00} because I waited until the last minute to re-certify ( which makes no sense, since the acknowledged that my re-certification was timely received by the Department of Education and my annual re-certification was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. ). I followed up with FedLoan Servicing on a few occasions to determine the status of my complaint, but they have yet to resolve it, and all of my online statements say that I have an overdue balance for XX/XX/XXXX. Recently, I received a call from FedLoan Servicing stating that they were going to report me to the credit bureau for my unpaid balance for XX/XX/XXXX.

Managing an account,"On XX/XX/2023, my US Bank checking account ending in XXXX was charged with a credit card payment in the amount of {$83.00}. Because I DO NOT use this checking account to make payments, this {$83.00} charge also resulted in my being charged a {$36.00} "" Overdraft Fee ''. I do not recognize this transaction and after doing a lot of research can not figure out why this charge was made to my checking account. 

When I called US Bank for help, it was very difficult for me to get anybody on the phone and when I did, the people I spoke with were not too helpful. While speaking with a US Bank representative, I asked where the {$83.00} was paid to because the online entry for this {$83.00} charge DOES NOT show where this payment was sent, who it was sent to, etc. The person I spoke with gave me 4 numbers. I asked her what these 4 numbers meant. She didn't know. US Bank didn't know what company the {$83.00} was sent to. I asked the US Bank representative to reverse this charge and the {$36.00} overdraft fee when she was not able to tell me where the {$83.00} was sent. She refused to reverse the charge and the overdraft fee and suggested that I speak with the US Bank fraud department.

When I spoke with a US Bank representative in the fraud department, who was speaking on a phone line that made it very hard for me to understand what she was saying, she said she couldn't take a fraud report. When I asked her why she couldn't take a fraud report, her voice broke up due to the bad connection on US Bank 's phone and the call ended. 

US Bank has sent {$83.00} from my checking account and has no idea where the {$83.00} was sent. US Bank has also charged me a {$36.00} overdraft fee resulting from this transaction because I do not keep a very large balance in my USB checking account because I do not use this checking account to pay my bills. 

I am requesting that US Bank reverse the {$83.00} charge and refund the {$36.00} overdraft fee that US Bank charged to me as a result of there not being enough money to cover the {$83.00} that should not have been charged to my US Bank checking account.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,6807030
Can't contact lender,"This should be described as "" can not pay lender back online within 3 days ''. Speedy cash has a policy where if you pay your loan back within 3 days you will not be charged any CAB fees. This is a great policy however they DISABLE the option to pay online during this time. So you have to go into a store with CASH to pay them back if you want to avoid CAB fees and interest. 

I find this practice to be extremely shady. Why not allow me to make an online payment after I have an active loan? Why am I not able to make an interest free payment online until after the interest and CAB fee kicks in? 

"" You have the right to make payments in any amount in advance at any time. "" In the screenshot I have attached you will notice there is NO way to make an online payment. If log in after the CAB fees kick in then the option to pay online show up.",,2229190
Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"XXXX is offering personal loans as described below : "" XXXX PERSONAL LOANS NO ORIGINATION FEES. NEW RATES AS LOW AS 6.49 % * '' I applied for this loan, however, was offered 9.99 % rate. When I called and inquired as to why I wasn't offered the advertised rate ( my credit score typically ranges from ~780-820 ), I was told that was because I'd need an 830 credit score to qualify for that rate. When I complained that I felt what they were doing was false advertising, they argued that credit scores go up to 950. This is very much a lie. Being in the XXXX XXXX, I quickly queried a database of 150,000 mortgage applicants, of which only 4 had over an 830 credit score, with the highest credit score being an 840. Based on my data, less than .0026 % of credit worthy applicants have an 830 credit score or higher. I personally feel that advertised rates where less than 5 % of the population would qualify for, borderlines on false advertising, however, what PenFed is doing is significantly worse. 

In my opinion, XXXX is advertising a rate that virtually no one qualifies for, which is very much false advertising.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3144852

2. I had called, emailed, and submitted several customer service emails ONLINE to report a problem with the types of bills they were sending me. 
3. Although I had been paying my bills ONLINE for several years, the online service suddenly became unavailable, preventing me from making payments online. I reported this many times, i.e. customer service, email, yet the problem persisted.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","XX/XX/XXXX, I entered a no penalty re-payment plan with Nationstar Mortgage, to pay XXXX month mortgage payment of {$2200.00} ; which they claim they had never received when my mortgage transitioned to them and they became the servicer. I spoke with service representative "" XXXX '' who communicated, that in order to start the re-payment plan I would have to pay the current month mortgage payment to him in the form of an automatic payment from my checking account in the amount {$2200.00} ( informed that there was an increase in escrow ) and XXXX monthly payments of {$370.00} added to my monthly mortgage.

During the month of XXXX I was inundated with telephone calls and debt collection letters from Nationstar, stating that I was XXXX months behind in my mortgage ; and they would start foreclosure if I did not pay the sum of {$4700.00}. Upon reaching Nationstar Mortgage XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with service representative "" XXXX ''. I informed XXXX that I was on a repayment plan beginning in XX/XX/XXXX and had authorized an automatic debit from my checking account to Nationstar for my XXXX mortgage and sent my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment in along with {$370.00} repayment amount. XXXX explained, for some unknown reason the prior representative ( XXXX ) failed to make the transaction. But, since I had made the XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment along with the repayment amount he could restart the repayment plan ; if I would make an electronic debit payment with him today in the amount of {$2200.00}, which would care for the XX/XX/XXXX failed transaction. The service representative ( XXXX ) also stated that I would also have to agree to a XX/XX/XXXX automatic debit of my XXXX mortgage payment plus the {$370.00} re-payment and a {$10.00} service fee ; which I agreed to all. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a postcard from Nationstar to confirm a verbal authorized payment back on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$2500.00} plus a {$10.00} fee amount ; which was more than I verbally agreed to. Also in the same time frame I received a letter congratulating me on being approved for a repayment plan. The letter has a page XXXX that enclosed a XXXX month schedule starting XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which should have been XXXX month schedule ; because my first original re-payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX along with XX/XX/XXXX monthly mortgage payment. Another issue with the schedule is that it has an increased un-agreed re-payment of {$380.00} ; this would add up to more than the amount owed. Thinking we could correct the issues later I continued to make the requested payments. Nationstar continued to mail the threating foreclosure letters and make daily calls to me, leaving no message. Contacting Nationstar, I was told that I was never on a re-payment plan because I failed to make a payment in XX/XX/XXXX ; I was also told that I was XXXX months behind in my mortgage. After having some serious communication with Nationstar, they said if I could produce my bank statements showing auto debit and monthly mortgage payments they would take a look and get back to me.

We now realize that this was a major mistake, because somehow, Citi Bank continued to charge us fees and interest for the next 15 years! We, however, knew nothing about this. We moved from our first house in the XXXX area to purchased another home about 10 years ago. Believing that we had no unfinished business with Citi Bank, we did n't send them notice of our new address. Nor did any mail from them get forwarded to us from the old address. 

The enormity of the mistake caused by our ignorance and Citi Bank 's failure to help us to understand what was happening was revealed when we sold our latest property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CO XXXX. Citi Bank had placed a lien against our property for {$23000.00}! The only reason we were given was that Citi Bank was n't able to find our new address. This is very hard to believe for these 2 reasons : 1 XXXX The cell phone number of the primary card holder had n't changed since we talked to them by phone 11 years ago. IF we still had unfinished business with Citi Bank, they could easily have called. 

2 ) If Citi Bank was unable to find our new address, how is it that they WERE able to place a lien against the property at the same address. 

We now fear that we may have never actually closed our credit card account with Citi Bank. If that was the problem, it was purely a matter of our ignorance, because we did n't intend to use the card ever again, and in fact have NOT used it during all of the intervening years. It appears to us that Citi Bank took advantage of this situation and did not explain what was happening to us. The total amount that we 've paid them since thinking everything was settled 15 years ago is approximately {$26000.00}. That is extremely excessive in light of the situation, especially since we have n't even used the account in all these years. We believe that Citi Bank should reimburse us most, if not all, of the money that they took from us when we sold our house on XXXX XXXX XXXX last year. This was money that we did not use in our account, and it is money held against us without any notification from Citi Bank. We are a lower middle class, working family on no public assistance of any kind, and now do not have the money to purchase a new home. Instead, we find ourselves renting a house in an undesirable neighborhood that is NOT healthy for our children.

Opening an account,"I am beyond disapointed by Bank of America they are nothing but liars and they have not helped me at all during this past month. A couple months ago I found out my account was closed, I called them and advised them that I currently wasnt working, but I would be soon be moving and getting settled with a new job and I would be able to settle my debts. I then asked the reprasentive the big question. Once my debts were settled would I be able to open a new account. The representative convinced me that if I paid off my balance, I would be able to open up a new account by the end of that week. So I pay the XXXX to make it right with my overdraft fee and the XXXX on my credit card with them. The week comes and goes and once I notice that the funds are out of my account I go back to the branch all I excited that things are comming along. I then get told that bank of america will never open an account with me again. Of course after that statement I was confused. Not only did the woman I spoke to earlier in the week say once I paid I could re open she never mentioned that my account also had supposebly a fradulent check that tried to be deposited. During that time of my life I was jobless and didnt have money comming in and Im not sure how it happned but my card was stolen. They told me to write a statement and my name would be removed from the XXXX XXXX   and XXXX XXXX. I also dared them to check out the survelliance for who ever diposted a check into my account because it was never me. It was theft. A month has came and gone and stilll no answers despite the fact I am constantly calling to make inquiries. I have no desire to ever have an bank account with tyrants ( BOA ). But the fact is I am a victim, I paid all my debts and still everyday I been getting nothing but the run around. If Bank of America is not willing to let me open another account, good riddance but dont mess with my livlihood, lie, give me the run around. Keep ur paid debts and give me back my XXXX name, Take my name off XXXX XXXX and XXXX so I can move on with my life, Bank of America is a self serving entity and I suggest you never choose them to be your home bank.

Trouble using your card,"On XX/XX/2021, CitiCard told me that my credit limit would decrease XXXX  XXXX dollars effective that same day. This is against the law that they need to give 45 days notice of a major change. I now have late fees for my utilities and it affected my credit score to have a large decrease. I had paid my bill ontime each month with the exception of a bill due XX/XX/2021. I had been out of town and could not log into my account and did not have the credit card. This is hardly a reason to all of a sudden drop the credit limit without warning. I am unable to log in online at all currently even though I just paid the past due balance plus some. It was not even a week late.

Late fee,"My last Citi credit card statement included a late fee of {$20.00}. When I called the company for an explanation, they told me it was for a late XX/XX/XXXX payment ; going on to explain that my payment is due to Citi on XX/XX/XXXX and THEIR records show that the payment was not received until XX/XX/XXXX. 

This puzzled and disturbed me because I had previously set up the payment electronically through my checking account to arrive on time. So, I did some investigating and as you can see from my attached XXXX Bank statement, the funds were electronically transferred to Citi on XX/XX/XXXX with an expected delivery date of XX/XX/XXXX 

Even if, for the sake of argument, the payment did not arrive on XX/XX/XXXX as expected, there is ABSOLUTELY NO WAY AN "" ELECTRONIC PAYMENT '' TOOK XXXX DAYS to get to Citi! The company may have refused to recognize it but they did receive it in advance of the due date. I am writing to you because I need your help. Citi has denied my request for a refund both on the phone and in a written letter. And I believe that this is unacceptable! A prime example of a big company taking advantage of the little consumer. Please help me because I NEED my {$20.00}. In this challenging economy, my husband and I are finding it very difficult to make ends meet. Therefore, I must pursue this matter as I can not afford to ignore it. 

Lastly, I would like the company invested to see how many other consumers electronic payments are being "" ignored '' so that Citi can charge a {$20.00} "" late '' fee.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I was an employee at the time that I took out a Business line of Credit with BB & T which is now Truist Bank. The agreement stated I would be charged {$100.00} annual maintenance fee starting on my origination date and stopping on my maturity date. My origination date was XX/XX/XXXX. This was a THREE YEAR line of credit. My line matured on XX/XX/XXXX. Prior to my line maturing the branch manager had called me and asked if I wanted to renew the line. I asked her what the new rate would be since I caried a balance on the line of credit. I was either going to pay it off or renew the line. Well my line matured on XX/XX/XXXX and Truist charged me another annual maintenance fee but closed off my access to the funds to use since it had matured. I heard back from the branch manager a few days later and I had asked her if I was going to renew the line, were they going to charge me an additional {$100.00} annual fee and she responded a few days later saying yes. So Truist not only charged me {$100.00} annual fee on my maturity date while cutting off my access to funds but they were going to charge me another additional {$100.00} annual fee on top of that if I wanted to renew the line. That is absurd and completely unethical. So now I have FOUR annual fees assessed on my THREE year line of credit. The branch manager asked for a refund because she was unsure of why the fee was charged on maturity date. She was denied that request. I then called in and spoke to a representative in their loan department who read the agreement with me and agreed that I should NOT have been charged another annual fee on maturity date when it clearly says it would stop on maturity date. She submitted a request for the fee to be refunded as well. She escalated the case to the customer care team in which I was to receive a call within the next 7-10 days. I requested a copy of that agreement I signed to be mailed to me since Truist had now removed my access from seeing it online. I called in a few days later to find out that her request had been denied as well. I spoke to that representative to review it with me and see where it makes sense that the bank would charge me again on my maturity date when the agreement clearly states they would not. I asked her as well to send me a copy of the loan agreement as well. She as well escalated the case creating a new ticket which I was supposed to received a call back within 7 - 10 business days. I then over the next 2 weeks kept calling in spending well over 15 hours on the phone trying to get this resolved. I then submitted a CFPB complaint in which XXXX XXXX XXXX out of XXXX called me from Truist letting me know she was going to handle my complaint. I asked her as well for a copy of the loan agreement to be mailed to me. Every request for a copy of the loan agreement up to this point had been denied. The bank was refusing on purpose to send me a copy. She spent about 20 days to get me her response in which she stated the bank was in the right to charge the fee because there was still a balance on the line at that time. She clearly doesn't not understand banking and how charging fees works and maturity dates work. I was an employee of BB & T/ Truist for 6 years until I left last year because of unethical things like this going on. I didn't want to be apart of it anymore. I asked XXXX again where was my loan agreement that I had asked for almost 3 weeks ago from her. She said she would now send it out after she has now closed the case. For whatever reason she denied my request as well in the beginning to send it out to me. She however did sent it out after she closed the case and I received it last week. I had received it over 2 months after I initially requested it. Thanks to my training on Fair lending practices and ethics training while I was employed at Truist, I understand and know what the bank can and can not charge fees for. The agreement is also very easy to read. It states under "" Annual Fee : "" The Borrower hereby agrees to pay an annual fee of {$100.00} on the due date of this agreement and due thereafter on each anniversary date of this agreement UNTIL THE MATURITY DATE as it MAY BE EXTENDED from time to time. '' What she and the bank has failed to comprehend is that the line of credit MATURED!! It was not renewed! The next section discusses the part where the maturity date may be extended from time to time. It states under "" Renewal : The bank may, at its option, renew this agreement in whole or in part, substitute a new instrument of different form for this agreement, or make changes in consideration of loan extension. The Bank may charge any fees permitted by applicable law for the MODIFICATION, RENEWAL, EXTENSION, or AMMENDEMENT of any of the terms of this agreement. '' Again I never renewed the line and the bank never renewed the line. The line of credit had matured. The maturity date was never extended. They can charge an annual maintenance fee if they decided to renew the line but they didn't!!! So therefor the only thing they can charge me for on the balance on the line is INTEREST! They can not charge me an annual fee on a line I no longer can use and then charge me interest as well. This is how class action law suits are started and how the reputation of bank can be tarnished. The only reason I had a balance on the line still was because I was waiting to hear back from the branch manager on what my new rate would be if I renewed the line. Once I found out they charged me a {$100.00} fee on the matured line and would charge me another {$100.00} fee again to renew the line I informed them I would just pay it off online. Then there online banking would only take max daily payments of {$1000.00}. Then there was days where their online banking wouldn't even allow me to make payments. I have screenshots of all of these. I called back XXXX to urge her legal department to review this before I get my legal team involved. I have left her 2 voicemails and she has refused to call me back. The bank should be ashamed of themselves for trying to take advantage of people like this. I'm sure they are doing it to others. If anyone else has seen this happen to them please contact your attorney. This is completely unethical and fraudlulent. Nowhere in their agreement does it say they can charge another annual maintenance fee if there is a balance on the line at maturity. Nowhere! It states the fee will stop at maturity unless the maturity date has been extended.

"Managing, opening, or closing account","I could almost check each and every one above. Rush card had a system update on XX/XX/XXXX. I had funds added to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. Funds I had XXXX XXXX to me to help out on bills I had. My car payment. Well I called in for a replacement card with mine being damaged. I was told 7 to 10 days. 2 weeks later still no replacement card. Then finally it came in the mail. I opened it to realize it was the same numbers just different expiration dates and different XXXX numbers on the back of the card. Didnt think anything of it. Well after calling for another 2 weeks i recieved my funds on my card XX/XX/2015. So the system told me my card was activated as well. One problem i had i couldnt remember the pin number so i called. Put my info in with new XXXX digit code on back and the operator told me wrong number. After a few times i tried my previous XXXX code from my first card and it still told me the same thing. So i got transfered to soneone i could speak to. Which shocked me. Few weeks prior i would have to select the feature of applying for a new card to talk to anyone live. So the gentleman told me i should have not gotten the same number when they replace card came in. I told him its not lost, no one has it. I had just damaged it accidently and i couldnt use it at all to swipe or to withdrawl. So didnt see how it would really make a difference. So, now once again he deactivated the card and sent me out a new one. Today is Wednesday and he told me it would be here Friday. I am wondering if this is the start of another two week checking my mail box to no card. Or better yet get charged for another replacement card that is sent quicker which costs more money. Someone has to pay for it. Either way I am back at square one with a XXXX Dodge Avenger that is about to be in a reporting for non payment which will effect my credit.

I guess i am wondering what Rushcard is going to do to help me when my car payment goes over a 30 day late payment where my account will be considered delinquent. They report me to all three major credit bureos. Which i spent over a year paying an agency to help get my credit half way decent.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"This complaint references previously started XXXX loan number XXXX, for XXXX XXXX. The residence address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX PA XXXX. The CFPB complaint number was XXXX. 

1. This mortgage started with XXXX. At a short time afterwards I fell behind and filed for bankruptcy protection. The loan was eventually sold to XXXX, Then XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX in XXXX, the current mortgage holder. Bankruptcy payments to the trustee each month for 60 months totaled {$41000.00} sent directly by the trustee for mortgage purposes. I want XXXX to account for where this money was applied in full. XXXX, when it purchased this loan, bought its history ( good and bad ) as well. No company would buy a mortgage that they couldn't verify correct amounts owed thru past records. XXXX has previously stated they "" can not speak to the actions of the prior servicer ''. XXXX has access to records of this, and I have every email and chart from my bankruptcy attorney for 5 years regarding this. I'm asking because I'm still looking for the destination of {$41000.00} sent from the trustee specifically to the mortgage company. Where did it go? In full. 

2. Escrow is still a mess. XXXX is still asking for an "" escrow short payment '' of an additional {$430.00} per month on top of the monthly {$600.00} set aside in each payment for escrow. Since the loan is now understood to be current as of XX/XX/XXXX, only 24 months ago ... and I possess bank confirmation of every single monthly payment in full ( and on time ) for every month but one ( XX/XX/XXXX ), how can escrow be short anymore than appx. {$600.00} total. Am I not correct in stating that escrow is only for taxes, and insurance? Specifically what, other than school and real estate taxes, and home insurance, has been paid or charged to escrow? Again, I was in bankruptcy protection. 

In an escrow statement from XXXX XXXX dated XXXX, escrow was listed as having {$16000.00}. They listed a "" required amount '' as {$4100.00}. That means that only 17 months ago, escrow was OVERFUNDED by {$11000.00}. Since that time escrow has received monthly dispersements of over {$600.00} per month from monthly mortgage payments. Thats roughly {$10000.00} ( plus 2 months where I have now paid an additional {$430.00} ) plus the amount pf overfunding totals just shy of {$24000.00}. XXXX has correctly listed needed escrow monthly at {$600.00}. At that rate, escrow currently would have been funded in whole for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ... and then some. Clearly money is being misappropriated out of escrow for other purposes. Rather than sending charts, I want a full accounting of specifically where every single dollar was paid out of escrow and for what purpose since the date of the XXXX XXXX XXXX Statement. Again, taxes and insurance only total a little over XXXX XXXX  a year. XXXX has $ XXXX to explain the whereabouts. 

4. My bankruptcy attorney and I have been asking for 18 months for a proper accounting of monies paid in vs amounts credited for the calendar year XXXX. Simply put, including the bulk payment made of {$27000.00} plus all 11 monthly mortgage payments made in XXXX, I have proof of payment for {$61000.00}. Mortgage reduction, taxes paid and interest paid only amount to {$51000.00}. Since XX/XX/XXXX, about the same time as XXXX entered the picture, we have been asking where is the missing {$10000.00}? Please account for this. If it is in the records for XXXX XXXX, then please obtain it from history. XXXX has access to this history ... they would not have bought the loan without it. 

5. All monthly fees ( at least 3 separate {$1300.00} fees, plus a {$500.00} BKY fee, plus $ XXXX late fees ) need to be reversed immediately. Many of these fees were assessed in bankruptcy, and all were assessed with the incorrect assumption that we were behind. We very well may not be behind at all, and may be in the back re current. XXXX continues to ignore this request and skips over it each time they reply. 

6. Since XXXX now agrees per their apology of XXXX that "" the total amount due was incorrect due to our system not being updated properly to reflect the bankruptcy filing '' we still need the following. After explaining in full each of the questions from above, a new "" total amount needed '' in full ( with date ) to bring this matter to a close. There is no way that the loan is still 3 months behind since I have payment in full confirmation from every month ( sans one ), starting from Spring XXXX. Based on # 2 above, there actually may not be any additional amount due, once all fees are deleted that have been randomly assesses without checking into the facts / history of this loan. We need a new total, with date, so this process can be brought to a conclusion.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,2930387

Managing an account,"I filed a previous compla9int against Navy Federal Credit union, due to the collection practices and untruths they were telling merchants about me. They had locked me out of my account statements stating I needed to update my phone number in order to release the block. After the complaint was submitted, I got access for a few days, and now locked out again after they received the complaint from this office. 

I had received some extra funds from VA due to backpay, and I asked that they take whatever I owed in bank charges due to my credit card and checking account fees accumulated. The accounts closed and written off after filing bankruptcy. When I received the backpay, the bankruptcy was dismissed and instead of refiling I paid off the debts possible with what I had, one being the vehicle. The credit union took XXXX and the bankruptcy court was refunding the money held for rent into my account and due to the landlord as the bankruptcy court required the payments be set up through them facing an eviction., The credit union then takes another XXXX. XXXX from the landlords ' checks without notifying me about the remaining debt I was trying to pay. There was over XXXX when I asked them to collect on the debts, and they wait til the bills are paid and I have XXXX and take the landlord 's check. I asked for a printout of the debt totaling the XXXX and the call center advised me I would have to get it from my statements. I asked them to break it down so I can see XXXX in service fees, because I was seeing service fees 3-4 times for the same issues. I now can not access my account statements to see the charges they took. All I have is he screenshot of current transactions, everything else inaccessible. Now they state I have to verify some security issues. 

This bank has now reimbursed close to XXXX, labeling it adj. I don't know for what or why or if that error caused all the other issues of insufficient fund 's charges, and merchant the money took by the check verification people In my last dispute, which they denied, they stated that they spoke to my bank who authorized the transactions to be collected by the XXXX XXXX XXXXy. The state they spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX  and received documentation authorizing the deductions. How does another bank verify authorized the withdrawal of another 's banks customers by a XXXX XXXX? And the bank, XXXX XXXX, has been no authority over any of my accounts as they are a credit repair prepaid Credit Card only company. They do not hold checking accounts. 

Navy Federal had no business discussing any banking activity pertaining to my Navy Federal Account, and no one has authority to disclose any PHI with another bank to deny a legitimate dispute. There was no investigation on the illegal access to my account, and the disputes department violated my privacy rights discussing anything with my credit card company, using my personal information to access the accounts. 

They are either trying to run me out or conspiring to set me up for some banking issues as they are lying to other banks, accessing my other banks to obtain information, and lying to merchants about me telling the bank that the checks area not mine, and that they are postdating them after I wrote them. The credit union has got me XXXX, ruined my reputation, and continues to lock me out of my accounts to prove the issues are legitimate, as they refuse to honor their reimbursement for Charges not mine.

Struggling to repay your loan,"Im here writing this for the third time today. 

Im putting a claim again Sallie Mae/Navient/NavRefi XXXX I have two articles that found not only by CFPB but XXXX. CFPB as come to an settlement with NAVIENT. I too have been a victim of their practices and here is how. 

I left XXXX XXXX for the Visual Arts back in XX/XX/XXXX. My loans started on XX/XX/XXXX. I was only working part time and was looking for full time work. I found a temporary full time job with XXXX XXXX A third party administrator. My last day was on XX/XX/XXXX. I was out of work from XXXX to XXXX where I found a full time job. With the same company. I was making a little above minimum wage. 

I called Sallie Mae at the time tried to get my 5 loan accounts payments lowered. I was given the options of Forbearances or deferment. No income driven repayment options were suggested. I took these options over the course of several years. I couldnt go in defult, because my parents names were attached to my loans as well. This made my loans bloom into payments of XXXX per month. Because of the capitalization interest that came with it and the fees to each loan just for saying yes, i want a forbearances. 

Also, I have all my late document that will show that Navient failed to allocate payments to my loan accounts. There examples of paying with in the month and still getting late fee charges. Examples of payment reversals and adjustments. Which added up to more Mooney for them. 

XXXX, my husband lost his job and again tried to call Sallie Mae to lower my payments and wasnt able to help me. I was steered heat again in to forbearances and or deferments. This is the reason why for all my late payments. Please see attachments. I was trying to steel from XXXX to pay XXXX. With two car payments rent and normal bills Sallie Mae/Navient/NavRefi has put my family in financial hardships for over 15 years. 

I have been swindled into paying more than my fair share on this loan. With the loan capitalization was added after getting out of an forbearances or deferment. See that Navient was digging me into a financial hole that i coulnt see myself out. 

Not only the financial hardships aspect, my husband and I weren't able to buy a home nor raise a family of our own. That has put a mental, physical and emotional toll on us that i can never get those years back. That has made a ripple effects on my parents as well has my mother-in-law. 

Fast forwarding to XXXX. I wanted to get my parents off my collage loans with Navient as co-signers. I called navient to see what I could do and my only option was to make so many payments consistently, then I could get my co-signers off my loans. Spoiler alert, that wasnt going to happen. I couldnt afford my payments. Yet again another road block. 

Then came late XX/XX/XXXX, where i found a flyer stating that i could consolidate my loans, though NavRefi. NAVIENT is co-owner with NavRefi. I figured that they offered me to be able to consolidate my loans and get my parents off as co-signers. I thought this would be perfect so I could get my college loans under PSLF and be done. Wrong. I wasnt able to do this because my collage loans are private entity. Which found out that i couldnt change them over to PSLF. 

Please see all attachments to this claim. 

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I have a Private loan serviced by AES. The lender is XXXX. I attended the University XXXX XXXX in NC and received a XXXX.

During my time in school I obtained several government student loans and I honestly do not remember obtaining a private student loan at all. I have asked for a copy of my application to confirm whether this is my loan and AES has refused. I decided I would go ahead and pay the loan to protect my credit. I have been paying on this loan and have never been late but the balance keeps increasing. AES has been applying all of my money to interest & not principal. The alleged original loan amount was XXXX and now they have me owing over XXXX. Over the years they have changed the interest rate & payment amount several times without notifying me. Just recently that interest has gone up again, therefore my payment has also gone up. I really value my credit rating that is why I continue to pay on this loan, but I really need someone to help me with getting confirmation from AES and XXXX to confirm that I actually signed for this loan and to review my loan documents to ensure that the terms of the loan are legal. I am pleading for the government to do a thorough investigation of AES and XXXX in reference to their loan practices. I feel they are taking advantage of honest hard working students seeking to advance their education in order to make a better life for themselves. It is very shameful and disgusting how AES & other lenders are allowed to commit these atrocities at the expense of students & their families.

Managing the loan or lease,"Harley Davidson Finance AKA XXXX XXXX is not computing their so-called simple interest contracts using the same formulas which change month to month in order to charge more interest to consumers. 
Additionally, XXXX is holding payments from consumers and posting them later in order to collect a larger per diem interest rate which makes them more profits and lengthens contract terms to their benefit. It also costs consumers more over the life of the loan in interest.

However the check was cashed on XX/XX/2023. The payee has not received it in their account. I went back to the branch for the copy of the check that has been cashed out. There was no endorsement at the back and I was told you could cash out a check without an endorsement using the app! The banker XXXX XXXX and another XXXX man were laughing regarding my questions about getting my money back since the bank paid to someone who is not the payee on the check. It was not to my awareness that anybody could cash a cashier check without an endorsement even the person is not the payee on the check. It is the bank responsibility to ensure that the fund is deposited only to the person payable to. The person I wanted to pay has confirmed that the check was not received and that it was not in the account and would like to confirm the last 4 account number that the check was deposited to but the bankers said they can not release that information until the claim department takes the case. It would take 10-30 business days. There is something wrong with the way the bank handle business. The cashier check should be the safest way where one can used to make a payment as it is drawn from the banks fund and it should know whether it was deposited to the payee correctly or not. I was told fraud is minimal using cashier check. The bankers asked me why I dont wire transfer or pay other methods instead of using the cashier check. The mistake is on the bank as they allowed the fund to be released even with no endorsement and the bank should be responsible in restoring my money back as they did not pay to the specific person I addressed on the check. If all the banks in US works this way then it is no point to mention on the check whom to payable to as anybody can cash the check using the app. The bank app must have a validation process to ensure that the check is deposited to the correct person.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"Agreement Per Our Recorded Conversation onXX/XX/2020 Tonight I spoke with XXXX in the Loss Mitigation department. Prior to speaking with her I did write a letter to my relationship manager and as of today 's date I have not gotten a response this was almost a week ago. She advised me of my current status PRE FORECLOSURE which I NEVER got any documentation to this effect. I only knew until she had given me a call which was an attempt to fix the error. Prior to speaking to her I called and spoke to a rep and advised of the upcoming payments which they had agreed and had already accepted the bank bill pay system. During the last few months this account was in more than 2 status at one time. I the consumer was not fairly given the opportunity nor advised what or where the account status was due to payments missing and no one actually knowing what or where this account was. I had made numerous calls. Never ever was I told I was in pre foreclosure nor was I given a specific date due to being in a pending status due to waiting on a decision on a modification on two failed attempts. I as the consumer/borrower I have made numerous attempts to fix this account with no assistance nor attempt by Select Portfolio other than this one call today from a rep that was very helpful and patient. I sincerely appreciate at least after many attempts today  someone is helping me I hope cause I am still uncertain due to their track record. I did try to schedule a payment and she advised that she did see it in the system where I made several attempts to get current. She was very nice and advised she would wait for the payments to come in before going forward to another level I am still uncertain due to them saying one thing and always doing another. I advised her that all payments would be in by XX/XX/XXXX and that I would be giving her a call on that day to see if she had gotten all payments as agreed a total {$7900.00}. The money she advised is needed regarding account to stop any and all collection activity. I advised her my intentions to keep the property and she was willing to assist me with assuring all payments are credited to account as she agreed. My only problem is that they would tell me one thing on the phone and do another thing later. I would never get things done as they said they would. I only would like documentation stating the agreement because when you hang up the phone the company does whatever they see fit. Putting my account further into FORECLOSURE would only cost me more money when something is agreed already unfortunately, for me as the consumer/borrower can not believe nothing they say because they continue to do the opposite after hanging up the phone. Not sure if it is because they may be short of staff or because it may be too many accounts that they can not keep track of. Or their reps are not keeping notes to any agreement that they make and the extensions. It is always something not correct or rectified causing constant delay and misunderstanding in communication with the borrower. I sincerely request that all accounts with this firm are reviewed for if this is happening to me it is definitely happening to other consumers/borrowers. Unfortunately, the reps do not understand or do not care that they are actually affecting many lives without any care nor concern to work with the consumer",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,3544748

Fees or interest,"Crate and XXXX/Synchrony Bank offers customers the option to get reward points or deferred interest on qualified purchases made using the XXXX XXXX. Purchases made under the deferred interest option are purportedly tracked under the cardholder 's "" promotional '' balance. Those made under the rewards program are tracked under "" non-promotional '' balance. Unfortunately, it seems like the company lacks the necessary computer systems to keep track of "" promotional '' balances separately from "" non-promotional '' balances, leading to incorrect interest charges on customer accounts. My experience is summarized below. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a couch purchase using the deferred interest option totaling {$3400.00}. The company reported my "" promotional '' balance as {$3400.00} on this date. 

Subsequently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I placed another order totaling {$870.00} using the XXXX credit card. I chose not to use the deferred interest option with this purchase. Because the company could not fulfill the order on a timely basis, I cancelled this order after few days. Accordingly, I received a credit of of {$870.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Based on my conversation with the company 's representative, this {$870.00} credit was going to be applied against the original charge. I thought my "" non-promotional '' balance was effectively {$0.00}. But this turned out not be the case. Instead of applying the {$870.00} credit to offset the original "" non-promotional '' charge, the company 's systems applied it to my "" promotional '' balance which is not subject to interest in the near term. Consequently, I was charged interest for carrying an average "" non-promotional '' balance of ~ {$800.00} for about a month. I found this out when I read my statement. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I spent over an hour with three of the company 's representatives to figure out what went on. I was told that this issue would be reviewed and that I would get an answer within two billing cycles. I was told that to avoid further interest charges, I need to pay off the incorrect "" non-promotional ' balance by the current month 's due date. Effectively, the company is forcing me to pay undue interest and pay off part of my "" promotional '' balance which I supposedly don't need to pay off until XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,4839301
Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I am set up on a rate reduction plan where XXXXNavient auto drafts their payment from my checking account. The payment amount is XXXX from my account is.

I am under the suspicion that they are trying to sneak in fees to further inflate what I owe. Also, my billing statements do n't seem to add up. Online it shows no more than XXXX or so but I 'm being drafted for about 4 times as much. I understand that paying more will help pay this down but I am already struggling to make these types of payments with my wage. 

They started me on this program last year and it seemed to take a while to kick in. When I called to ask, they gave me some crazy excuse of the payment not going through and tried to make me pay a higher price because "" I was late ''. I checked with my bank and all of my money had been there the whole time. I would really like you guys to pull the recordings from last year. I believe they were looking for a way so that I could n't pay the {$550.00} each month but more instead.

Recently XX/XX/XXXX I called to inquire about my remaining balance, to my surprise it was very close to my original balance when I first bought the rings. I spoke with a supervisor at wells fargo and she said my balance was high because of my late fees and because I had missed their promotional one year no interest so XXXX % had been added on. I explained to her what I had been told on several occasions about paying every other month. Wells Fargo said that is not their policy and they were sorry if someone misinformed me. I requested that she look back through recorded conversations, ( which they warn about every time you call ). It took a week to get back a hold of this supervisor in which she said non of my transactions had been recorded.

Late fee,"Hello, After receiving a credit I requested, I am being told I must still pay the disputed amount to keep my account in good standing. Even though by doing so, I will incur a credit balance. To ultimately get my refund, I must call Target after I 've paid and they 've issued the refund to again request a refund to be issued by a paper check? BACKGROUND : first you need to know I rarely use my Target credit card. However, after receiving a letter that my card would be deactivated if I did n't charge something before a certain date, I made a point to stop at target and buy something because I thought it useful to keep my card active. However, I have moved and since I rarely use the card, the bill was delivered to my previous address. When I actually got the bill it was XXXX XXXX, the day before the due date of XXXX XXXX. After working with Target.com for over an hour on XXXX XXXX, I finally was in a position to pay my bill online, the only means available to me to make the payment on or before the due date, since it was too late to pay by mail, and I could n't get to the nearest Target ( XXXX miles away ) to pay in person the next day. So, I paid my bill online, or so I thought, on XXXX XXXX. The next day, when checking my emails, I realized I did not receive a confirmation of my payment. I checked my bank account and there was no evidence the payment had been made. I logged in to target.com and my payment was NOT noted. So ... .I paid my bill but unfortunately for me it was after XXXX on XXXX XXXX. Today, XXXX XXXX, I received an electronic notification of my target bill and was shocked to see {$26.00} in charges. ( A {$25.00} late fee plus a {$1.00} minimum charge ). I promptly called Target and was told since my account was in good standing, Target would waive the {$26.00} and credit my account. HOWEVER, I WAS TOLD BY THE AGENT AND BY A SUPERVISOR, XXXX, THAT I MUST STILL PAY THE {$26.00} TO KEEP MY ACCOUNT IN GOOD STANDING! I asked why since my bill is not due until XXXX XXXX. Why should I incur a credit balance of {$26.00}? Supervisor XXXX confirmed the charge had already been waived on my account. The answer was I could call back and get a refund check sent to me. Really? It will cost Target more than {$26.00} to take my call and issue a paper check. Please, can you please do something about this. I believe this is a predatory practice so Target can get the funds and reap the benefit of interest earned.

Late fee,"My credit card issuer, XXXX, assessed my account with late payment fees of {$25.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$35.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$35.00} on XX/XX/XXXX which were all a direct result of XXXX 's payment system being unavailable to access requests from XXXX and their Customer Care Agents providing incorrect payment processing information. In speaking with their Internet technical support services staff 3 days prior to the initial fee assessment they informed me that they were not able to provide an alternative and advised me to contact the XXXX 's Customer Service telephone line during regular business hours. They assured me that my access attempts and phone call were logged and that the matter would be rectified without penalty.

Fees or interest,"XXXX : This issue still has not been resolved to any reasonable end. Citi has continued to issue responses placating my previous complaints, offering no further proof that I proactively enrolled in the Payment Safeguard program, instead insisting that the statements issued over the lifetime of the account were authorization enough. Of course this is absurd, as if to say continued abuse of the relationship is permissible so long as it goes undetected. Consequently, I maintain my current position that Citi 's responses thus far have been nothing more than boilerplate and the issue remains unresolved. 

XXXX ( Background ) : Citi 's response to my complaint lodged through the CFPB is their latest attempt to further placate me. They've provided no additional evidence that would prove I willingly enrolled in the Payment Safeguard program, only suggesting that my activation of the card was consent enough. What's more, they included a veiled threat to alert ratings agencies of any delinquent payment activity due to the dispute, despite the fact that my account is in good standing. This was a boilerplate response that aims to dissuade me from any further action. 

XXXX ( Background ) : I've been a Citibank credit card account holder since XXXX, and it recently came to my attention that I'd been enrolled in their "" Payment Safeguard '' program unbeknownst to me. This is a program that, to the best of my knowledge, I've never agreed to participate in, but have nonetheless been subject to, exposing me to years of monthly fees totaling in the thousands. Over the past months I've contacted Citibank on numerous occasions requesting proof that I willingly enrolled in the "" Payment Safeguard '' program. In each instance no such proof could be relayed by phone, only a promise to share such details by mail. I've since received two identical letters ( one of which I'm including in this complaint ) suggesting that I enrolled in the program XXXX XXXX XXXX  with no evidence to support my authorization ( something that was promised when speaking to Citibank representatives by phone ). What's more, when speaking with Citibank representatives I was assured this was a program I would have had to proactively enroll in, suggesting that such proof of consent exists. Still, no details have been offered. As far as I can tell Citibank fraudulently enrolled me in their "" Payment Safeguard '' program, collecting monthly fees I never authorized and has placated me in all attempts to refund said monies.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,7043360

Can't repay my loan,"I was approved for XXXX private loans between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The loans totaled just under {$50000.00}.

These loans were serviced first by XXXX XXXX and then by Navient from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, at which point I was able to consolidate them with a move reasonable company. During those 9 years, the loan servicers were incredibly unforgiving of any personal or financial hardship I experienced. During my mother 's illness and death I was unable to work as I was caring for my mother. XXXX XXXX was unable to put me on any sort of payment plan other than the full amount, which forced me to defer my loans which increased the total amount owed significantly. Following that, they were unwilling to enroll me in any possible payment plans, frequently telling me there were no plans available for my loans. The debt of these private loans has prohibited me from buying a home, traveling, and experiencing other typical life events, despite working XXXX-XXXX jobs at all times to pay them back. I currently pay more in student loan payments each month than I do in rent in XXXX. 

The most alarming part is that I should never have been given these loans in the first place. I had no established credit at the time. Now, as an adult, I do n't understand how I was even allowed to be given these loans. I make a lot more money and have significantly better credit now and can not receive a loan of that size.

My payment amount is {$560.00} I was told that I was very late and I needed to make a payment I asked the representative why was I 51 days past due and I had just made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$560.00}. XXXX XXXX operator ID number XXXX, told me that it was a late fee of {$90.00} and that when a payment is made they take out the late fee first and then apply the rest of the principal and interest of the loan. I told her that that was not how loan companies work the late fee always goes towards the back of the loan she stated to me that we do things different here not like everybody else I requested to speak to a manager and on XX/XX/XXXX a manager called me and he told me the same thing. After we hung up I received another phone call from an agent named XXXX I told her that I would make the payment of XXXX XXXX but not the late fee she told me she would not do that and that she has dealt with me on many times I explain to her what was going on and she told me OK XXXX XXXX have a good day she never told me that my vehicle was up for repossession at all. My payment is due on the third of each month and I 'd already made my payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX the car was repossessed over the {$90.00} late fee. Looking back on my credit report I see that I 've never had on-time payments with them because of the late fees they still count on your credit as you never made the payment on time. When I called to get the car back I was told that I needed to pay {$810.00} and {$560.00} was for the payment and {$250.00} was for the repo to get the car that I never paid the late fee now for the next two months they have altered my payment to pay the fees to cover the late fees.

She proceeded on to tell that she was closing the case because there was nothing else that she could do for me and she offered again to send me another copy of the contract.

I asked her to send me out a letter stating what was going to take place now she told me that a letter would not go out. He was very very rude and would not let me talk. A fair resolution would be for them to fix my credit pay the repo fee and take off the late fees that of been associated with this account.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"Dear Sir or Madam, I had Federal student loans with XXXX XXXX that were transferred to Navient in XXXX. I attended XXXX and XXXX school, completing my education in XXXX XXXX. Upon graduation, I consolidated my loans with XXXX XXXX. I recall having an APR of 1.9 percent upon my consolidation. I noticed that a XXXX statement from XXXX XXXX has 2.6 percent. 

Recently, in just the past month or so, I have received an email from Navient stating they have accepted my deferment request. I emailed their help center and told them this is an error, or someone trying to hack into my account, since I DID NOT request a deferment. They sent an automated email back saying they are sorry I am having financial difficulty and options under such circumstances. They could n't even bother to have a human read my complaint/error report. Additionally, my APR is now 2.85 percent. I consolidated my loans at a fixed APR for the life of the loans. 

Navient has no after hours helpline, and since I am in Hawaii and they are on the east coast it is very difficult to find time to call them during the work day. I will obviously make effort to call this coming Tuesday morning first thing since I am extremely frustrated and feel cheated. 

I feel something criminal is happening and all Navient can do is send automated replies after 8 days of my written error report. I have had much better luck with email inquiries with companies such as XXXX, XXXX, and others. Naivent seems very shady and I am going to look into an alternative company to house my student loans.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"My student loans went into default last year, and were taken over by Conserve. After researching options for resolving default, I called Conserve yesterday and spoke to "" XXXX '' who was not my particular assigned agent ( "" XXXX '' was not there ). He insisted on collecting a great deal of contact information from me before talking to me about options available, asking what I was capable of doing. I told him I was interested in getting information on Consolidation or Rehabilitative payments, but he said he wanted to "" run through a list of options, beginning with paying off the entire loan ( ~ {$140000.00} ) with the included ~ {$67000.00} in penalties ( ~ {$200000.00} ). Next, he wanted me to pay a "" settlement amount '' in the amount of the original loan. XXXX options are beyond my means. After I let him know again that I was interested in either rehabilitative options or in consolidation, and primarily options concerning consolidation, he moved on to rehabilitative payments and he began to ask questions about my financial situation and household, saying he could n't talk to me about anything else until he had that information. He began to collect more information about my job, my salary, household, etc. etc. and insisted that I send paycheck stubs to him immediately. When I let him know these were not immediately available, and again that I was primarily interested in talking about consolidation, he finally looked at the XXXX separate loans I have through the XXXX, then explained that once you consolidate, you ca n't consolidate again. As a result, I "" could n't consolidate '' because of the XXXX ( of the XXXX ) I 'd already consolidated. XXXX immediately went back to asking questions about my financials so he could figure out a payment plan for me. Again, he was asking for paycheck stubs and personal information about my family and household. I interrupted him to tell him that I believed I did qualify for consolidation, at least on the loans that had not already been consolidated. He said he was n't aware of any information on that, and asked me where I 'd thought I 'd read that. I pointed him towards the XXXX website on getting out of default and read it to him, and he then quickly explained that had assumed that since I could n't qualify for XXXX of the loans that had already been consolidated, that I "" was n't interested in doing that. '' I asked him how to go about applying for consolidation ( through them or through the XXXX ) or finding more information on that, and he said he was not aware of the program and that I should go ahead and arrange a payment plan with Conserve. I told him that I 'd call them back when I contacted XXXX, or able to talk with someone who understood student loans, and XXXX then let me know that maybe I could talk with XXXX and figure this all out with Conserve tomorrow. 
In subsequent research, I have found that ALL my loans qualify for consolidation, without the {$65000.00} in penalties Conserve was attempting to impose. 
XXXX, acting as an agent of Conserve, was clearly trying to obfuscate options available to me to resolve my defaulted student loans. XXXX was intentionally and deceptively withholding information. He was clearly working from a Conserve script to present only the options that were advantageous to Conserve ( most profitable ) and to ensure that I, as a borrower, did not feel confident in either in my understanding of the loan or default process in order to assure that they make maximum profit. XXXX did so by pretending to be ignorant of policies and practices ( consolidation, and policies surrounding consolidation ) that would be clear to anyone working in this field.

Approximately thirty minutes later I also purchased a TV with a 12 month no interest promotion. The washer and dryer purchase amount was {$2200.00}. The TV purchase amount was {$500.00}. XXXX 2015 an interest fee was charged to my account in the amount of {$1200.00}. The explanation I received was, the charges were n't paid in the 24 month period. When I reviewed my records I paid {$2400.00}. I paid for the washer and dryer, but I received interest for the washer and dryer.This would leave a balance of {$260.00} for the TV. If the TV had the shorter time frame but was purchased after the washer and dryer interest should have been applied for the TV not the washer and dryer. In Speaking with many customer service representatives no one could explain why my money was not applied to my first purchase. In other words my monthly payments were applied to the TV first. I reviewed the contract and could not find an explanation for this action. I was told to go to the store and speak with a supervisor.

The statement reads as follow, We will apply the required total minimum payment to balances on your account using any method we choose. Any payment you make in excess of the required total minimum payment will be applied to higher APR balances. Applicable law may require or permit us to apply excess payments in a different manner in certain situations, such as when your account has a certain type of special promotion. I 'm not sure how this statement is justification for what has happened. I have called 10 - 15 times and was told by every representative not to pay on account while in dispute, yet I still received late fees which were removed after I questioned the fees. I received a letter from Synchrony Bank explaining the fee is justified and will stand as a valid charge with no break down of charges, fees, and payments. I 've been given a number to the escalation department and told there hours or XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX. The number XXXX is not a valid number for this department. Basically I 'm getting the run around.

Payoff process,"On XXXX, I contacted a customer service rep at Sears Credit Card. I arranged via phone to pay the credit card off. With Sears writing off some interest, the total amount that the representative told me to XXXX this card out was {$2000.00}. I paid that amount during this same phone call and was even offered the opportunity to now transfer other credit card balances to this account that may be high interest. On XXXX, I noticed that instead of a XXXX balance, my balance showed {$290.00} after payment. I e-mailed Sears about this and ultimately received an e-mail to contact them directly that these matters do n't get handled through e-mail. On this date I reached an individual on the phone who identified himself as XXXX. I explained the above to him and ultimately he said that even though I was told that the account would be XXXX after payment that it was still my responsibility to pay this new balance. He even went so far as to say that I get statements which I told him that I did not get paper statements that I could still log in and get my balance. I told him I understood all of that but in the end I had a live representative on the phone telling me account information and confirming XXXX that after payment my account would be XXXX. In getting no where with XXXX, I asked to speak to someone else in charge and he refused to do so after several attempts, he kept saying that I was accountable. I then asked direct questions as to whether or not he was refusing to give me another rep and ultimately, he said he would and put me on hold. He then came back briefly to tell me he 'd be sending me to a rep. I waited on the phone afterwards about XXXX minutes without feedback from anyone until I hung up. My total call time was XXXX minutes. I would like for Sears to honor what I was told and XXXX my account out. If this does not occur, I will certainly have no choice in paying this additional amount of {$290.00} and will then promptly close this account. I am amazed that even though I talked with their own account rep that ultimately I 'm told that even though they said that, it 's not true. These are shady business practices and XXXX needs to be dealt with regarding his poor, customer service skills as well as keeping me on hold without feedback or another representative getting on the line. I guess he got his revenge against me for questioning him and Sears by placing me on hold and no one coming to the phone. Nice tactic!!!!

A credit plan or open-end consumer credit plan which is an open-end credit plan or open-end consumer credit plan within the meaning of the preceding sentence is an open-end credit plan even if credit information is verified from time to time. 

Let me break these laws down On XX/XX/XXXX you closed my account without my approval. 
I was never late and always paid on time. I gave you a security instrument which was my signature. What law says that you can close an open-end credit plan without my approval? A closed account is never closed. Once something is open it's always open, Im just not getting any benefits from it. Under 15 U.S. Code 1602 Truth in lending act I am the original creditor, therefore you can not close an account without my written consent.

Ultimately, I expressed my intentions to be proactive prior to accumulating missed payments in the future then continuing to fall further behind. Each representative had expressed similarly that they can appreciate my effort to reframe from missing future payments, yet there are no additional repayment options available for me. They continued to explain that if I was currently 31 days or more past due other options would be available at that time. If they are capable of offering other payment options after 31 days past due, they certainly can make those same options available to those that are struggling to avoid late payments. Therefore, after different attempts to voice my concern with various representatives, Campus Partners will still not provide me with an alternative repayment option to avoid missing payments due to my financial situation. 
Since graduating in 2013, each of my federal and private student loans has now transferred to repayment status. I have continued to place my federal loans in forbearance in order to afford the private loans and other monthly expenses. After graduation, the income I accumulated from my employment was insufficient to pay for each private student loan I acquired over my collegiate years. Therefore, I was compelled to utilize the brief forbearance period allowed which is no longer available. Over the last few years, I have been blessed to obtain advancements in my career, which have generated increased wages. Even though my income has increased, the payment obligation for each monthly expense and student loan continues to exceed my total monthly income. Currently I receive about XXXX a month after taxes. My total expense which include current student loans being repaid is about XXXX. If I forgo other monthly expenses and limit my grocery/personal budget, the total expenses could be reduced to about XXXX. Even if the forbearance option was available, I would prefer not to delay my obligations. In conclusion, I would greatly benefit from lowering my monthly private student loan payment.",,2070290

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from GreenSky to set up my account. I would received 12 months, no payments required with interest deferred. My first payment was due XX/XX/XXXX and if I did not pay off the load at that time interest would be added and accrue. I planned to pay the {$9500.00} before XX/XX/XXXX so there would be no charges or interest. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX that the windows would be installed on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from GreenSky asking if the job had been completed.

Lost or stolen money order,"On XX/XX/2021 I purchased a MoneyGram money order from my credit union XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX union. Its for {$670.00} money order reference number # XXXX. I filled it out in permanent ink making it payable to my landlord XXXX XXXX. My name XXXX XXXX as signature and my address as well. I mailed it using the mailbox in my neighborhood on the corner of XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2021 that money order was cashed but my landlord still states he hadnt received it. I went to my credit union and was told they use third party money orders and I have to take it up with MoneyGram. I called MoneyGram and was told that I would have to pay {$18.00} to request a copy of the money order. I did that and waited almost 3 weeks to receive it in the mail. When I got the copy it is clear that this money order was altered as the criminal only wrote over my words on there. 
So now I have the copy and I called MoneyGram back and was told that I need to request a description of where the money order was cashed. This service was free but necessary in order to start the process for refund. I waited a week for that email. On XX/XX/2021 I got the email from MoneyGram that told me XXXX XXXX bank cleared the money order on XX/XX/2021 and gave sequence # XXXX. MoneyGram says the money order cashed on XX/XX/2021. 
I then called XXXX XXXX and was met with representatives that told me they will have nothing to do with this. They wont trace the sequence number. They wont help me at all. 
I called MoneyGram back and now with the copy of the money and the email with the source that cashed the money order, I can now move forward with the actual refund process. I am currently waiting on an email and a hard copy of an affidavit to fill out and return to MoneyGram. They state the process could take 3-6 months possibly a year for a refund and even then its not guaranteed. I just dont know what to do. My landlord needs that rent and I need my home. 
The criminal was able to get my money right away without a hitch. Im the victim and I have to jump hurdles just for someone to help or even hear me out. 
XXXX XXXX was the front line of defense to protect me against this criminal act and they failed. I do not have an account with XXXX XXXX so I was told I cant file a complaint with the Office of Comptroller of Currency. 
I was referred by the OCC to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to file the complaint because its a MoneyGram money order. 
Please someone help me.

Delinquent account,"I applied for a fully secured credit card through First Progress on the month of XXXX of 2015 to improve my credit scores. I 'm trying to apply for a mortgage loan in the year to come so having new credit is important to me. My boyfriend completed the credit card application for me because he has had a credit card with them for the past year and it helped his credit improve. Unfortunately I was un-aware that there was an annual fee that was due the first month of being approved for this type of credit card, besides the fact I never received any notification ( written or verbal ) indicating the annual fee was due. After a month or so of not receiving any correspondence I called First Progress and became aware of the late charge and the delinquent annual fee. At that moment I took care of the charges and paid the account completely, I asked the representative if I was going to receive a 30 day late on my credit report and the rep said no. I asked for a confirmation number and a full name, but she said that they do n't offer that. After a month or so from this conversation I pulled a copy of my credit report and I saw that First Progress had reported a 60 day late on my credit report, I called them right away and tried to resolve this issue and all they said was to send them a written dispute and they would look into this. Since that time I have spoken to several representatives and I have not been able to get this 60 day late on my report corrected or removed.

If you can not provide this contract, then I am not the owner of this debt. The organization who has this contract is now the debtor. The reason I asked for my signature is because this organization used my signature as a form of transaction to sell to other third-party security markets to profit. This 3rd party debt collector left a receipt of this inquiry ( XXXX XXXX ) on my consumer report to destroy my credit. So, therefore, I am not the owner of this debt. If you can not send me the contract, then by law you have to remove this student loan from my consumer report. Do not send me a bill, I am asking for a contract of this debt with my signature. Again, do not send me a bill. Please remove US DEPT OF EDXXXX, US DEPT . OF EDUCATIO, and USDOEXXXX from my consumer report. Failure to comply would leave me no choice but to take legal action against this consumer reporting agency.

Problem when making payments,"I have a business credit card with Barclays, a XXXX card. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed in a payment by check for the full balance at the time, {$2600.00}, check # XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The face of the check had the last XXXX digits of my account number on it, and it was enclosed in a sheet of white paper with my full name and address and account number. 
That payment was never credited, and on XX/XX/XXXX my payment went past due. Around that time my card was locked and i called to see what happened. I was told they never received the payment. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the check was paid by my bank. When i discovered this I called on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a security person to confirm that Barclays had cashed the check. On the back of the check, was a stamp with the following : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Barclays XXXX I spoke to XXXX, who was a manager. She said she would open a missing payments case so the matter could be resolved. She told me it would take a XXXX  of days. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the card was still locked and i called on the status of the missing payments case and spoke to manager XXXX XXXX. I was told a missing payments case had never been opened. XXXX XXXX opened a missing payments case # XXXX. She transferred me to XXXX in customer service to help me. XXXX told me that the payment HAD been located. XXXX told me that she could apply a credit to my account that would unlock my card within about a day. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the card is still locked. I called and talked to XXXX XXXX who told me that the payment had NOT been located. XXXX told me the missing payments case would take XXXX days to to resolve. He also told me I would receive a letter in the mail with information from the investigation. I told him I was not at my home address, i was traveling, and could not receive mail until XX/XX/XXXX. He told me if i could not receive the letter the investigation would be closed. This is outrageous and unreasonable, as Barclays has my phone number, email address, and there is a "" messages '' portal in my online Barclays account where they can communicate with me. 

Barclays lost my check for nearly a month, locked my account and charged me finance fees and late fees. Then they cashed my check. They have the money, as of XX/XX/XXXX. Yet they give me conflicting information, fail to start the required missing payments case in a timely manner, and refuse to unlock my card, despite the fact that I PAID my balance and they received it. Now they tell me that because i am not at my home address to receive a paper letter, that the investigation will likely be closed and I suppose the payment never credited.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,6480730
Lost or stolen check,"On XX/XX/XXXX Wells Fargo closed an account I had opened with them on behalf of my father using my power of attorney. They had allowed me to open the account and I had deposited into the account money from the sale of his property. I had used that money then to pay off some of his debts. A few months later Wells Fargo informed me that I didn't have the proper power of attorney to open the account and told me I had to go to a branch and close it. I went to my local branch and they issued me a Cashiers ' check for {$8500.00}. When I asked them when the check would expire they told me that it would not expire. For various reasons I let the check sit. 

Two weeks ago I went again and opened another account for my dad using my Power of Attorney. This time I was told I had all the proper paperwork and the account was opened. I deposited the cashier 's check into the account after the banker assured me I would have access to the funds. At no time did the banker helping me tell me this would be an issue. A few days later I log in and find out that the check had been deducted from the account. After several phone calls from me to them with no follow up from Wells Fargo I was told by Wells Fargo that my check had been sent to the State of Pennsylvania as unclaimed property in XXXX of XXXX. At no point in time did anyone inform me that this action would take place, nor did they send anything to my father because he also has my address. Now when I went to start my unclaimed property check with the state of pa, I found that they have no record of this being sent to them by Wells Fargo. The complaint department at Wells Fargo told me they couldn't at this time provide me of evidence that they had sent the money to the state. So as it stands right now my family has been robbed of {$8500.00}.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,4003345

Delinquent account,"1. There has been a Wells-Fargo failure to have selected and facilitated a purchaser of the past due debt on a Wells-Fargo Credit Card ( i.e., a card ending in # XXXX, that was purchased by a firm named Investment Retrievers ) to be a firm that can be relied upon to comply with the 7-year maximum Federal Law to timely correct a defaulted ( "" charge-off '' ) credit card debt reporting error in this complainant 's personal XXXX credit report. ( More specifically, this erroneous credit report listing by XXXX XXXX relates to XXXX. account beginning with # XXXX. ) This failure to remove a major negative in the credit report of this complainant after the 84th month ( i.e., after 7 years ) has continued beyond the 30-day period following XX/XX/XXXX - the date this complainant phoned in this error to XXXX and created Dispute file # XXXX. More specifically, the error is in the XXXX removal date - where XXXX has not deleted this negative from this complainant 's XXXX report after the end date of the 84th month - the date of XX/XX/XXXX in this case ( in contradiction with the facts I provided in this complainant 's phone call to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and via Faxed documents on the same date ). Apparently XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not verify the 7-year end-date to the XXXX late fee transaction posted ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) in the records of the original creditor for this debt - Wells Fargo Bank. 

2. Investment Retrievers is a debt purchaser. The original Wells-Fargo credit card for this debt ended in the acct # XXXX. 

3. The specific documentation of this XXXX late fee date ( of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) is attached to this complaint. All of the documentation for correcting this complaint error is described in a multi-page letter filed with this 4th CFPB complaint. Also provided with that letter are a number of documents, including ( a ) the recent Complainant 's XXXX credit report page that includes this error, ( b ) copies of an XXXX Invalid Dispute reply that fails to correct their error, i.e., a reply that ignores the documentation this complainant provided that irrefutably supports this complainant 's corrections, and ( c ) copies of the creditor 's contemporaneous monthly statement postings of the XXXX late fees to prove and correct this error using the books of the company that incurred these charges - this complainant 's employer. The attached letter also explains how these debts are all company debts and that none are personal ( non-business ) charges made by this complainant. This complainant is losing income because the major credit report negatives that remain in this complainant 's credit reports are preventing this complainant from successfully pursuing and securing a financial manager - or other trusted position - in the job market. 

4. This complainant 's lost income damages are also detailed in the attached letter. In summary, these damages are $ XXXX per week-day, as this complainant is a victim of fraud and as such, this complainant 's state law specifies treble damages. The damages resulting from the 7-year end date credit report errors began on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX in the case of this 2nd CFPB complaint involving the XXXX XXXX purchased Wells-Fargo credit card ending in # XXXX ( major negative ) still in this complainant 's report after that date by XXXX.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1778056

Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"XXXX XXXX. I contacted the company and requested a pay off balance and was told I would receive it in the mail. 

XXXX XXXX contacted the company and was asked to call their attorney to give me a pay off balance. 

Last year, I had XXXX XXXX. Before this XXXX I went to their office to sign paperwork deferring my payments since I also had insurance with my loan, which was supposed to make the payment. 
I was assured the insurance was making payments. When I called the company to ask when my insurance would run out, I was told since I had unemployment insurance and I was unemployed almost a year prior and the insurance company did not send the payment I was told that that payment would cover me for 4 more months. This did not happen. 

I received a notice from their attorney a few months later during me for non payment. 
I went to court and the attorney apologized and stated it was the fault of the company and not mine and she dismissed the case and an agreement was signed stating I did not owe any attorney fees and if at any time I did not make payment on my account when due, 15 days after the due date I would have to pay attorney fees. This has never happened because I always made payments on time. After the agreement was signed I contacted the insurance company to find out why they never paid landmark when I was unemployed. They claimed lendmark never forwarded them documents they requested. Documents I had given to lendmark were never given to the insurance company. I was asked to resend those documents and when I did, the insurance company paid within days of receiving them. 

However, I have asked several times for a pay off balance and have been told to speak with their attorneys because I may owe attorney fees. I stated I had the agreement and I also believe they should have a copy of the same agreement because the attorney assured me she was sending them a copy the same day. Several times they acknowledged the receipt of this agreement but once I asked for my payoff balance no one wanted to give it to me. 

My last attempt was on XXXX where I had to ask for a manager and I told him I had no business with the attorney so I would not be calling and since my loan was with their company it was in their best interest to provide me the information I wanted on my account. He refused and told me he would contact the attorney and get back to me.

When I received the latest bill, it indicated the previous bill was not paid. The day I read the bill, it was 14 days late. The same hour that I read the bill, I called the billing line to inquire about the situation and to check if there were additional amounts accrued to that bill. I asked the representative on the phone, ( "" XXXX '' ), if I could just make the payment in full prior to the next due date and I simultaneously asked him when the late payment would be reported to the credit bureau. He indicated it must be 30 days late for reporting to take place and so we both agreed it would be best if I just make the payment right away. I told him I would just make the full payment ( the 14 day late portion, the small late fee of {$11.00}, and the following months payment that was n't due yet ). He then asked if I would like to make the payment right now on the phone and I indicated that it would not be necessary since the method I have been using to pay the bill for the last 10 years has worked just fine. I also indicated that I would be making that payment when we got off the phone. But before we signed off, he abruptly indicated he wanted to bring another representative on the phone so I could tell him what I just had been discussing with the current rep XXXX. I replied that it was n't necessary to do so but if he wanted to convey the information to that other representative, then feel free to do so. The conversation ended as it began : cordially and politely. 

As I was queuing up my banking website to make the payment as indicated, I got a call from a representative from Quicken Loans 4 minutes later who I assume was the representative that I said I did n't need to talk to. Although he was polite, he had begun to use the word "" collection '' and again tried to get me to make the payment over the phone. I was a little irked at that point but still calm and polite and I indicated that I had already cleared this up with XXXX and that I would make the payment by the same means that "" has always worked for both me and you [ your company ] ''. However, before we ended our conversation, there was another call from another billing representative ( or perhaps a billing collection representative ) that was trying to ring through on the other incoming line ( it was the same caller ID ) At this point I was taken aback about the aggressiveness of the representatives and use of the word "" collection '' when, not only was my bill paying history so good for 10 years, but also that the payment in question was ONLY 14 DAYS PAST THE DUE DATE! 

When we ended our conversation, I had, of course, finished paying the bill through my banking website which was scheduled to arrive to Quicken Loans in two days. 

I got an XXXX # call the next morning. When I answered the phone, it was a call from AN ACTUAL DEBT COLLECTION AGENT! I was not friendly anymore as you can imagine since she was using the language as if she was collecting a debt that was 120 days late. -- '' this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information you provide will be used to collect that debt '', etc. etc. Within that conversation, I asked several times if she had reviewed my 10 year payment history before she called me. She would not answer. I reiterated that that one payment was only 15 days late. She said I owed some lesser amount just cure the debt and I indicated I already paid the full current balance. I told her that the company did n't call me on this, but rather I CALLED the company to make sure I got "" the right amount of dollars and cents out to you when I paid the bill ''. 

She would not hang up the phone because she was using collection tactics, again, on somebody who was only 15 days late for the first time in 10 years who had already initiated communication!

Payoff process,"I had a 0 % interest rate on a Discover Card, which expired on XXXX/XXXX/16. There is an existing 0 % rate, which expires on XXXX The card has never been used for purchases since I obtained these rates ; thus the only balances on the card are the expired rate, currently in the amount of {$7100.00} at 15.24 % and {$3600.00} at the 0 % rate. I have consistently paid well above the minimum payment due ; yet, the amount over the minimum rate has not been applied to the interest-bearing balance, most of which has been applied to the 0 % rate. 

Consequently, my 0 % balance has gone down, while the interest-bearing principal has remained at roughly the same amount or increased. This is contrary to similar situations on other cards ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) in which the interest-bearing amounts have gone down consistently, along, with the 0 % rates. I have consistently called Discover to inquire about this and have been told that interest is accruing on a daily basis and that the interest-bearing principal is consistently increasing. Again, I never use cards which have promotional rates for purchases and my interest-bearing principal on other cards with expired rates has shown marked decreases ( even those with higher interest rates ). 

My understanding is that anything paid above and beyond the 0 % rate is applied to the interest-bearing amount. Again, my other cards with expired rates show marked decreases in interest-bearing amounts, while Discover Card apparently applies a different protocol. I would appreciate having the CFPB look into this matter so that I can determine if I am mistaken or if DiscoverCard has found a way to keep the interest-bearing principal as high as possible.",,2141341

Managing an account,"XX/XX/2019 Customer : XXXX XXXX XXXX CR XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX USAA Customer # XXXX Company : USAA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX ( XXXX ) XXXX Complaint : On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from USAA indicating that I had a late payment on my auto insurance. I was threatened that if I submitted another late payment I would not have access to my accounts ( checking, savings, policy, products, etc. ). In addition, I would not have access to additional services and/or products from USAA. My payment was made within the grace period, and my insurance has never been cancelled due to non-payment in 28 years. 

On XX/XX/2019 I called USAA to inform them that I made all auto insurance payments within the due dates and/or grace periods. My insurance has never been cancelled or reinstated in the 28 years I have been banking with USAA. The employee confirmed that my insurance has never been cancelled and all payments have been received within the time dates and/or grace periods allowed. 

1 ) I received a threatening letter indicating that future late payments would result in punitive actions such as no access to accounts, policy 's, and/or products.

2 ) USAA does not specifically stipulate what is considered as a punitive payment time period. When is a payment considered late with punitive measures ( no access to accounts and/or products )?

3 ) Is a payment beyond the grace period, such as a cancellation of auto policy equal no access to accounts, products and services ; and deem that a customer does not have access to their checking/savings accounts or USAA products?

4 ) Is a late payment within the grace period still terms for cancellation of auto policy, no access to accounts, products and services ; and deem that a customer does not have access to their checking/savings accounts or USAA products?

The attached letter from USAA was offensive. My payments have always been made within the payment date and/or grace period of payment. If USAA is going to submit such offensive, threatening, oppressive, and harassing letters ; it is important that USAA clearly defines such punitive measures to their customers.

Resolution : Without retaliation upon this customer, USAA needs to define punitive measures and at what point punitive action will be taken. Further, do these punitive measures follow the state law and regulations with the FDIC, State Board of Insurance, and the Consumer Financial Bureau? Are punitive measures fair  practices or discriminatory practices? Is it fair to ban a customer from an insurance policy or cancel a policy, lose access to checking and savings accounts, lose access to usaa.com, lose access to automated voice response system, and unable to acquire new products and services on the basis that the customer is late, however has made payments within USAAs stipulated grace period? 

It seems that left undefined by USAA is discriminatory to the customer, especially if the customer has paid within the grace period criteria and the customer has never received a cancelation in a purchased policy. 

I do believe USAA needs guidance in defining punitive customer exclusionary practices and measures. This should be approached without retaliatory measures to the customer. After complaining on XX/XX/2019 at approximately XXXX my account was locked and I have no access to my accounts. This seems a bit suppressive, oppressive, and discriminatory to the customer. I would like it resolved promptly.

On Wed XX/XX/2019, I was speaking to Mr. XXXX, and he told me my file was no longer in review for the loan modification. He stated that they closed it out but would look into the reason why, and call me back. He stated he escalated the issue. 
No one ever called me back! 
On Thursday XXXX XXXX I called Loan Depot back and they told me that they closed my file due to not having enough time to review the file. She stated by Law that they need to have the file 14 days prior to the sale date. 
I told her that they did have it, i met that time frame. She stated I didn't as the letter they mailed to me stated that "" it can not be reviewed due to receiving the application less than 15 days prior to the sale date.

The issue I have with Loan Depot is the following : I was told my file was in review and nothing was needed and my sale date was being postponed. I contact an attorneys office today and they stated what Loan Depot is doing is called Dual Tracking. Which means Loan Depot is processing a submission for a loan modification while also pushing the homeowner through the foreclosure process at the same time.

Late fee,"Sears credit card : I mailed my payment in for the full amount of {$22.00}. The due date was XXXX/XXXX/16 ( a Sunday ). My payment arrived on XXXX/XXXX/16 ( a Monday ). My next bill showed a payment amount and a {$2.00} interest charge. I was confused because under late fee it said {$22.00}, but I sent in my {$22.00}, so I sent in the {$2.00} thinking that was because I was one day late. The next bill came and now it said I owed {$48.00}. I could n't imagine how so my daughter looked into it and we realized that they said I was late ( even though on this site it says that it should not be late if the mail is n't delivered on due date, and the payment arrives the next day ) AND that they had charged me a late fee of XXXX % of my due amount ( {$22.00} ) which was not only outrageous but confusing. So I called the account question phone number and they would n't do anything. In fact they tried to tell me that if the due date is Sunday I have to have it mailed there by Saturday. I have filed a complaint with them but am worried that they will continue to add charges OR if I pay it, they will not eventually reimburse me. Also, I ca n't imagine why their computers do not adjust for the due date on Sunday event where payments received by mail on the next day, Monday, should be considered on time, and therefore probably are illegally charging late fees to many people.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,1855584

Their reason was : "" its not a Citi bank error ''!!!!

Lost or stolen check,"Reason ( s ) for complaint : 1 ) Navient cashed my tax return cheque after I settled my student debt.

My debt with Navient was resolved before I filed my taxes. Navient received my tax return on XXXX XXXX, 2017. They supposedly mailed it out on XXXX XXXX to my home. I called to verify a week after XXXX XXXX and the lady replied that yes, it 'should ' have gone out. Over three weeks have exceeded from the initial mailing date and Navient still refuses to provide any additional information. I have received several pieces of mail from Navient within the last few months, but the cheque still has yet to arrive and Navient refuses to work with me.

Struggling to repay your loan,"XXXX XXXX colleges push debt is time barred. I received less than XXXX and have received no refunds nor civil monetary remedies thus far. 

XXXX I filed for Bankruptcy which discharged in XXXX. It's public record Firstmark Services received notice timely by Bankruptcy Court as to the Discharge. Firstmark didn't show up to Bankruptcy creditor 's meeting nor object to the discharge within the time prescribed by bankruptcy law. Even though debt was time barred, the Firstmark 's representation using Nelnet Servicing LLC continued filings in an adversary proceeding which should of concluded in XX/XX/XXXX. This is XXXX colleges pushed private debt of XXXX. Firstmark never timely closed down nor reported as Bankruptcy discharge on credit bureaus. 

Initial Contact for collection activity after bankruptcy from Firstmark XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX in an email to one of my XXXX accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a debt validation request. Firstmark 's response included fraudulent documents which were never a part of my original note. 

In the Bankruptcy Firstmark was represented by attorneys on public record. I sent a debt validation request on XX/XX/XXXX but the company has failed to show my legal obligation to pay the XXXX private XXXX College's-pushed debt. I fully dispute and do not agree to incur further debt nor agree with the company 's unconscionable terms. Furthermore, the company has now listed "" Nelnet '' as lender (??? ). Also rather than closing down files respectfully like other companies do when in Bankruptcy, Firstmark actually added to the debt and requesting large monthly payment from me. 
I have not signed a note to pay Nelnet. I have not received disbursement of the amount that Firstmark and associates want to collect from me. {$3600.00}. Furthermore, now Firstmark added enclosures that have nothing to do with it even fraudently attempting to change state. I'm sure that in XXXX there was no clause stating that debt would not discharge in bankruptcy, nor any clause of the company 's right to recover other fees and costs. Firstmark subjects and or associates have certainly tampered with documents. I can not verify the info Firstmark Sent me. Also apparently Firstmark and other associate subjects if any to a scheme have clearly used false misleading deceptive practices. For example, passing it around to attempt to avoid various discharges such as the earlier action of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to provide civil relief to harmed consumers. For example, a company conduent was mentioned but I have never received notice they were ever my servicer. The Firstmark company keeps changing stories. I never received notice of deragotory reporting when in XX/XX/XXXX Firstmark inaccurately had the XXXX colleges pushed private loan as in default and with a 30 payment at a t union credit. When I timely disputed ( in the past ) with that credit bureau the subject company and associates merely would verify. Then my XXXX XXXX account apparently was hacked for a while and I had to recreate. Now the company is misreporting in another credit bureau Importantly, I want to maintain all my consumer rights. It's only right that I receive civil monetary relief. I understand about statute of limitations. There are recent violations by the company. I've put in years of efforts seeking justice to no avail. I have received no refunds of payment I made nor for my time. There has been great suffering by myself and I have not received fair monetary remedy. 

I've also endured cyber concerns believed to be associated with this company and it's representation. Today prior to submitting a complaint I had to reset my password with CFPB and have had to reset on other sites. I do not recall having filed a complaint on here. I have experienced much undue hardship and have suffered damages associated with my attendance at the XXXX colleges institution impacted directly during the pandemic. I believe the company also used overshadowing after I sent debt validation request. Please pardon any typos",,7510016

Struggling to pay mortgage,"In early summer 2018 I learned of a foreclosure on my home at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX RI XXXX I contacted both the loan servicer ( Ditech ) and the foreclosing attorney ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and was told that it was too late to reinstate the loan, and the auction would proceed as scheduled. 

On XX/XX/2018, the auction was held. The winning bidder was a friend that bid on my behalf, and he placed a {$5000.00} deposit with the auctioneer. 

We attempted to make final payment, complete the auction, and schedule the closing in the weeks following, however on XX/XX/2018, we received a notification from XXXX XXXX XXXX of the following : Hello, I am sorry to inform you but It appears that in light of the new opinion issued by the XXXX  XXXX, the sale held on XX/XX/18 for this loan, will need to be rescinded. Since Rhode Island General Laws Sec. 34-27-3.1 was  previously repealed, no compliant notice was sent prior to foreclosure. We have advised our client of the same and are awaiting instructions regarding return of your deposit. 

Following receipt of this notice, contrary to what XXXX XXXX XXXX told me earlier, we learned we were in fact able to have the loan reinstated. 

We completed that, however we had to pay a number of fees totaling {$3600.00} related to the rescinded auction which was improperly handled by XXXX XXXX XXXX, the foreclosure trustee. We would like the auction fees totaling {$3600.00} removed from the mortgage balance, since the auction was invalid solely through the fault of the foreclosure trustee, not the property owner or the auction winner. 

Following mortgage reinstatement, we attempted to pay off the mortgage per the attached payoff statement from Ditech. A check for {$36000.00} was sent XX/XX/2018 and funds were withdrawn from the issuing account prior to XX/XX/2018, which was before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline mentioned on the payoff notice. To date, these funds have still not been credited to the mortgage account, and during phone calls today Ditech representatives indicated that the check had been returned. This is not correct, a cancelled check copy is attached, and clearly indicates the funds were deposited to Ditech, the check payee.

I urgently need this money in order to buy food for the rest of this month. On XXXX XXXX, 2017 I sent this fax to the Levy Processing/Legal Orders Department regarding taking part of my SSI payment funds from my Savings Account and my Prepaid Card as fees for processing a legal order. This is illegal. SSI payments can not be garnished or levied. Wells Fargo also now claims that my Prepaid Card is overdrawn by {$77.00}. I can not understand how a bank can draft a Prepaid Card and create an overdraft in order to pay fees to another department at that bank.
This is a very unethical way to manage a Prepaid Card for a customer.

Lost or stolen check,"BANK OF AMERICA HAS BEEN MISLEADING, ELECTRONICALLY TRANSFERRED {$500.00} FROM MY ACCOUNT AT ANOTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, AND HAS NOT RETURNED THE FUNDS On XX/XX/2020, I opened a consumer banking account at Bank of America. I received an email from Bank of America, confirming the account was approved ( attached here for reference ). In order to fund the account, I set up two transfers from my other financial institution : one for {$250.00} to the new Bank of America checking account, and one for {$250.00} to the new Bank of America savings account. 

On XX/XX/2020 my original account showed the two deductions of {$250.00}, total of {$500.00} was transferred to Bank of America. 

On XX/XX/2020, I received my new Bank of America debit card. Also that day, my new Bank of America app showed my account was locked, and provided a phone number to call. I called the number and the Bank of America representative informed me that the account was closed for possible fraud and instructed me to go to a branch in person with two forms of id. This was alarming because 1 ) FRAUD -!?!? and 2 ) I am avoiding in person contact during the pandemic. 

On XX/XX/2020, I went to the Bank of America branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The representative had me call the fraud line. That person informed me that 100 % of accounts are able to be opened online, but then they get closed because you must go in person with two forms of id. I asked the rep these questions but they had no response : WHY IS BANK OF AMERICA ENABLING ONLINE ACCOUNT OPENING IF IT IS GOING TO BE CLOSING THE ACCOUNT? WHY WOULD I BE ISSUED AN EMAIL FROM BANK OF AMERICA STATING THAT THE ACCOUNT IS APPROVED? 
The rep told me that I must open a new account, deposit money, and destroy the card I was sent because another new card must be issued for the new account. The rep told me that two checks for {$250.00} each were sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX. 
WHY WERENT THE FUNDS RETURNED IN THE MANNER THEY WERE RECEIVED : ELECTRONICALLY? 

Because of this excruciating experience, I decided not to open another account at Bank of America.

He tried for 1 hour, and then transferred me to his Supervisor XXXX. XXXX said same thing he had, then transferred me to XXXX at the Escalations Department of Bank of America.

Getting a credit card,"Wells Fargo Bank apparently is using nonfinancial, and probably illegally obtained and applied, data and criteria, to deny me a credit card, and is probably committing these illegal practices industry-wide. 

Despite telling that, by its own standards, it regarded me as an "" excellent '' credit risk, Wells Fargo, where I have banked for over 12 years, denied a credit card to me on the vague grounds of an unspecified ratio regarding credit bureau trades and number of revolving bankcards. Wells Fargo nonsensically offered my credit counseling to improve my credit score of XXXX out of 850 points. 

Despite asking for a re-evaluation and an EXPLANATION of what these vague bases meant and how they trumped by other excellent credit history over more than thirty years, and despite pointing out that there is absolutely no derogatory information in my credit report to even hint I could not or would not pay off its credit card, Wells Fargo has steadfastly maintained, without any further data or explanation, that it made the correct decision. This absolute refusal by Wells Fargo to explain how those two arbitrary, technical numbers have any relevance to my credit risk or ability to pay off its credit card, or how or why my otherwise spotless, decades old credit history is trumped by these unexlained numbers, and the bank 's stubborn insistence, without explanation that its decision was correct, leads inescapbably to the conclusion that Wells Fargo is using some unrevealed, and illegal, set of metrics, data or criteria in its lending decisions. 

I short, since there is no rational, explainable, financial reason for Wells Fargo 's decision, and since the bank refuses to even try to explain its decision, it obviously is concealing something in its decision process that it does not want the public or regulators to know. 

My initial application was in XX/XX/XXXX, application number XXXX. It was denied by letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, in which it was stated that by credit score was XXXX out of 850, but I could counseling to improve it! I asked for reconsideration XX/XX/XXXX, which was denied by a second letter on the same grounds. I had an online chat about XX/XX/XXXX with Wells Fargo, in which they could not or refused to explain their decision, and opened a complaint for me only after I threatened to withdraw my funds. That complaint resulted in a call from XXXX XXXX in the Executive Offices. She knew nothing about the reason for the denial, could not explain it, and could not fix it. She referred me to underwriting to talk to the underwriter responsible for personally reviewing my application and denying it a second time. I was not allowed to speak to that underwriter, however, and the person I did speak to in underwriting knew nothing about the reasons for denial and could not explain them. He opened a new complaint for me though (! ) which resulted in another call from the Executive Offices ( one "" XXXX '' ) who also knew nothing about the stated reasons for the denial and could not explain them. 

I continually was advised to contact the credit bureau which provided Wells Fargo with the excellent credit rating, with no explanation why I should do so or what I would complain to the credit bureau about. I eventually did so, and found absolutely nothing derogatory in my credit report. 

In the meantime, at the repeated urging of Wells Fargo, I arranged a meeting with a banker at my local office in XXXX, Washington. Just before that meeting, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received yet another communication from the Executive Offices, again standing by the decision to deny credit, and still refusing to provide any further explanation. At the meeting with my personal banker on XX/XX/XXXX, I found that he, too, knew nothing about the reasons for the denial and could not explain them. He tried to suggest the denial was based on my debt/income ration, but that is not and never has been Wells Fargo 's stated reason for denying me credit. He opened still another complaint for me, assuring me of a better response. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received still another letter from Wells Fargo, still obstinately refusing to explain its decision, but insisting it was correct. On XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote to XXXX XXXX XXXX, Senior Executive VPf for consumer lending, XXXX XXXX, Senior Executive VP and COO, and Wells Fargo 's Credit Card Services, demanding an explanation. I In response, I received still another letter from Wells Fargo 's Executive Offices, insisting, without explanation, that its unexplained denial was sound and correct and would not be changed. 

During this entire, up to this very moment, Wells Fargo itself says I have, by its own evaluation standards, "" Excellent '' credit. I even have a {$10000.00} credit line with the bank! 

It seems inescapable that Wells Fargo has an undisclosed reason for denying me a credit card. Its utterly intransigent refusal to explain it inexplicable basis for denial, and it insistence that it's unexplained and unjustifiable reasons are correct, simple prove that it has reasons it is not disclosing and does not want revealed to the public or to regulators. These reasons likely are illegal and inappropriate. Given Wells Fargo 's history of improper and illegal activity, this is not an unreasonable conclusion. 

Please keep in mind, I have no need of a Wells Fargo credit card. But I do have a need to a lawful, financially justifiable, rational basis and explanation for the denial. Wells Fargo simply, utterly refuses to explain its decision, and by that refusal plainly indicates it has made it decision on some improper and most likely illegal basis. It seems likely that it is making similar unlawful decisions, using undisclosed and illegal criteria and data, in all its lending practices.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,4300125

I asked, how can you charge me interest and not give me the option to pay the loan? She started to get very agitated and stated nothing can be done for a couple of weeks. 

After speaking with Capital One, I called your offices and was told to file a complaint. Everyday that passes I am being charged interest for a loan I do not need or want. It is unfair for the Capital to charge me if by the contract terms I can pay at any time without a penalty.

To change the automatic disbursement among multiple loans, a payment must be made and then a phone call must be placed to them during their business hours, and a request must be submitted to change the payment. The process is too long and difficult, and they have only successfully completed this request one or twice out of multiple attempts. It is in their benefit for my extra payment to be placed on my no-interest loans instead of my loans with interest, and I believe this scheme to be intentionally so. It is too difficult for an average consumer to pay down the high-interest student loans. There should be a less cumbersome method for choosing how to allocate payments among multiple loans.",,2016669

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"XX/XX/XXXX I had been paying on my XXXX XXXX Synchrony Bank ) XXXX XXXX account on time every month and I was noticing that my balance wasnt really going down. I did a deeper dive and I saw that XXXX had been charging me a monthly Card Security Fee that I did not authorize. 

I called and I spoke with the customer service representative and told her that I wanted a full refund of the Card Security fee that I had unknowingly been paying. I also told her that I wanted to cancel the Card Security Fee service. I told her that I did not recall signing a Card Security agreement. She said that it was over the phone. I asked if there was a recording or signature and she told me no and proceeded to talk about some sort of policy. She said that I agreed to it back in XXXX, in which I do not recall. 

I asked the representative how much Ive paid since enrolling in XXXX. She responded by saying Whats on my screen, is the past 12 months. I asked for the total payment past 12 months. She responded with the same thing. I asked if she was capable of looking at the total amount paid beyond the past 12 months and she said No. 

I as a customer should be given an honest answer when asking how much money Ive been paying on my account. I didnt know that companies could withhold information on what has been paid to them by the account holder. 

The representative offered me a Card Security Fee refund for the last 6 months payments. I declined and told her that I wanted the full amount of what I paid in which she refused to tell me. 

The representative then offered me a Card Security Fee refund for the last 12 months payments. I declined and told her that I wanted the full amount and if I cant get the full amount, I wanted to escalate it. 

I asked to speak to a manager and the representative put me on a hold. Long story short, conveniently, the manger wasnt available and she stated that the manager would give me a call within XXXX business day. She then said another employee would contact me in 3-5 business days. 

She proceeded to wrap up saying that she processed the Card Security refund for the amount of the last 12 months. I told her that I didnt authorize the refund because it wasnt the full amount as requested. She then told me it was too late and in order to escalate it to management that she had to process the refund and couldnt cancel it. I told her that I didnt want this processed and I wanted to escalate it once more. She said that I would have to talk to another employee once they called me. The XXXX representative was trying to hurry up and process the transaction to say that she gave me what I asked for.

Opening an account,"On XX/XX/2020 I received a letter from CHASE indicating that they have a promotion available for me if I open a new business account and fund it with {$1000.00}.

I did exactly what the specialist told me. In fact, I had over {$10000.00} in the account. After I realized that I only need to maintain a minimum of {$1000.00} to make the promotion valid, I went into the branch to withdraw the additional {$9000.00}. I immediately went into a CHASE branch and explained to a bank teller the situation & SPECIFICALLY ordered the teller to withdraw the maximum amount that will leave {$1000.00} in the account. A month later I recieve a statement indicating that my balance fell below the required {$1000.00}. The bank teller incorrectly withdrew more leaving only ~ {$990.00} in the account for whatever reason ( poor arithmetic skills, lack of training, intentional ). As a result, CHASE notified me that that could no longer honor the {$300.00} promotion.

Late fee,"On more than a half dozen occasions, Wells Fargo has charged me late fees for payments made on time. My payment is due on the XXXX of each month. This past month, my bill was in the amount of {$250.00} and was due on XX/XX/2016. Wells Fargo mails the monthly invoices sometime between the XXXX and the XXXX of the month. For the bill due XX/XX/2016, they mailed the invoice on XX/XX/2016. I paid my bill by automatic payment on XX/XX/2016. Because it arrived before they mailed the invoice, they did not credit it to the XX/XX/2016 and charged me a late fee. Essentially, they have created a variable period within each billing cycle where I can not make a payment. In this past month 's case, any payment made between XX/XX/2016 ( the day the XX/XX/XXXX invoice was due, and was paid in full ) and XX/XX/2016 ( the day after they mailed the invoice ) would float in the ether and not be credited towards the invoice due for that billing period. This has happened over and over and over. I have filed several XXXX complaints and each time Wells Fargo reverses the payment. It requires constant vigilance. I can not believe other consumers are not being hit with these fees too.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2124141

Closing your account,"I have a Citi Double Cash credit card for years and have accumulated a lot of cash back. On XX/XX/2018, my credit card was closed without any advanced notice. I noticed that my account was closed on XX/XX/XXXX when I tried to buy something using my credit card. I called Citi right away to confirm and also tried to redeem my cash back. I was told that I can't redeem my cash back, but an online representive told me that I can redeem my reward four days later ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 

I called Citi again on XX/XX/XXXX, and a representative AGREED to redeem my cash back and said a check will be mailed to me. However, TWO WEEKS later, I received a letter saying that my reward can not be redeem because the cash back was forfeited at the time of account closing. The only option to redeem my reward is to reopen my account. 

I called Citi again on XX/XX/XXXX to see why they refused to redeem my cash back. No clear explanation was given. An account manager said there is nothing she can do unless I reopen an account. However, I do not want to reopen an account because I have opened new credit cards during these two weeks I have waited. 

As a long time Citi customer, I felt I was poorly treated and everything is poorly communicated. With that said, I summarized my complaint below : 1. My account was closed WITHOUT any notice, even when I used the card EVERY DAY. 
2. Citi did not honor its promise. I was told that my reward could be redeemed on XX/XX/XXXX when I called, but Citi refused to do so later. 
3. Poor communication. I was informed TWO WEEKS later that my reward couldn't be redeemed unless I reopen my account. During these two weeks, I have opened new credit cards with other banks. I do not want to reopen an account because I do not want to open too many credit cards in such a short time frame.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2977046

Can't stop charges to bank account,"I was in need of money and I decided to get a payday loan, but I made the mistake of doing it online. I got matched with multiple lenders and they called me in the first stage with what they had to offer. I renewed a little later again with them since I almost lost all my money paying it back to them. So, now I am short of money again and I re-borrowed. The interest rates they have and the number of loans are prohibited by the State of Indiana. Also, these loans and their companies are illegal and not licensed in State of Indiana. I talked with Department of Financial Institutions ( DFI ). They said these are illegal practices. They suggested I close my bank accounts and call out these lenders who get people sucked into traps like this when they can not actually even offer or enforce these based on the State Laws.

I have never missed a payment on this judgment since created. However, Navient reports every year a new charge off charge to my credit report and does not reflect my current payment history. Also, they are continuously adding interest to my loans which the court order clearly states no interest included in the balance. 
I am in the process of purchasing home most recently as XX/XX/XXXX Navient has reported missed payment and charge off negatively to my credit report. When I am in good standing with XXXX/collection agency. This impacted my credit score by XXXX points.

  Re: Formal Complaint Regarding Incomplete Contract Work   
This letter serves to highlight a number of protracted issues that have developed between the undersigned a customer and the XXXX XXXX and which requires urgent managerial intervention. It was agreed by home depot to the effect following work in my North Carolina home-  
Flooring   
Kitchen cabinet re-modelling  
Work on the flooring was scheduled to start on the XXXX of XXXX XXXX with an estimated timeframe of 5-7 days to complete. The remodelling of the kitchen cabinet was scheduled for between XXXX XXXX XXXX to start and complete the entire process.  The work to date has not been completed despite 23 store visits, serval trips from CT to North Carolina, telephonic complaints (I have spoken to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and customer services) your telephone recordings will verify my statement and I have also emailed my complaints. In addition, despite the numerous complaints, home depot has failed to refund me for unused material, neither was credit awarded to me for 49 boxes of first material and 38 boxes second returned unused material. The present situation is tantamount to the breach of contract, not only in the incompletion of contracted work, but also with the sub-standard quality of the work done so far. Another compelling example of shoddy work, are damages to my wood trim all around, because it is over cut. Home depot must ensure that the shoddy work be corrected, and the incomplete section of job be completed without further delay.  
On the basis that XXXX XXXX has not completed the work it was contracted to do, I have been forced me to live another State, as it is not feasible for me to live in an incomplete house. This has resulted in me suffering significant economic loss. XXXX  XXXX tardiness has also inconvenienced me, and in the process cost me unbudgeted expenses that I have incurred, which have taken a toll of my family and myself especially my young children. The situation has being further compounded by XXXX XXXX, which has unjustifiably overcharged me for items that fixed prices were determined and paid for which as reflected on the electronic receipts, (Appendix 1 and 2) for work that is still yet to be completed. HXXXX XXXX inability to complete the contracted, coupled with the unbearable inconvenience and out of pution of this seemingly intractable situation within 72 hours of receipt of this letter.  I will forward!

Struggling to repay your loan,"i am paying off loans ro Navient Corp a predatory lender since 2008. Very little money has gone to the principle of the loans most monthly payments were applied to interest. My loans have mushroomed to {$150000.00}. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and struggle on social security to pay off loans. 

I requested a statement of all payments applied to loans since inception in 2008. I have 6 pages of payments and more money has gone to interest than to the principle, which means if this continues I will not be able to pay loans off in my lifetime. Also Navient under reported Intrest paid on loans yearly to IRS. Causing me to pay more in income taxes. 

I need Navient to apply payments correctly as stated on their web site, I also need forgiveness of loans related to the nymber of years I have been paying them and the intrest is above usuary standards. I would get a better rate from a loan shark. 

Action : I have applied for income based repayment and spoken to reps who have n clue what Im up against.",,4599105
Fees or interest,I have called Discover three times to get this straightened out. I called and agreed to pay {$26.00} and they would waive the late fee. I did it. via phone pay. They did not waive the late fee. I got another bill for {$26.00} late fee. I called. They said the would waive it. I got another bill with two late fees. They keep charging me a late fee. The account should have been zeroed.,,2583836
Dealing with my lender or servicer,"When XXXX XXXX moved to Navient..my loan was on deferment. They move the interest rate from 6 % to over 11 %. In addition, at that time my bankrucy paid over {$14000.00} to XXXX XXXX for my loan but it was never used to reduce my loan and in fact my loan increased from XXXX to over XXXX. I have paperwork to support this and sent to Navient and they said they could n't do anything because it was something that XXXX XXXX should have taken care of however XXXX XXXX letters came back to me because they do n't exist. So no one can tell me why my XXXX payment was n't applied to reduce my loan and why my loan went from XXXX to over XXXX. I need help and have no where to turn.",,2299151
Late fee,"On XXXX XXXX I had a payment due on my Chase credit card. I went online at approximately XXXX CST to make this payment and completed the payment around XXXX that evening. After my statement was cut I noticed that I had received a late fee on my account and the payment that I processed at XXXX on XXXX did not go through until XXXX. I was unware of the cut-off policy that Chase has that payments processed after XXXX EST are processed and dated for the next business day. I then later found out that if you call customer service and process a payment over the phone they can date the payment for the same date until midnight the same day. Because of the lack of information given and available to me the customer service rep that I spoke with on XXXX stated that he would be reversing the late fee assessed to my account since I was late by & lt ; an hour and if I had know about the payment policy I could have easily avoided this situation. 

I have since messaged Chase numerous times following up on this fee reversal and they claim that they do not have a record of my call on XXXX and will not reverse the fee. I am very disappointed given the circumstances and the commitment by the customer service rep that the fee for this "" late '' payment is still outstanding.",,1426753
Can't contact lender or servicer,I've called at all times of the day several days a week only to be left on hold for 20 plus minutes only to have my number and message taken and not be called back. When I opened the loan they took seconds to answer. Now that I want to pay it off early they refuse to answer the phone. They could make payments possible online but they don't. It's clear they want the loan to remain unpaid to collect as much interest as possible. It's infuriating when all I want to do is pay what I owe. It appears this is part of the Elk lending business model.,,4961488

Closing an account,"I tried to open a bank account with HSBC a few months ago ( XX/XX/2022 ). Due to the fact that I missed a few calls where HSBC asked for additional documents, HSBC decided to close my account and to deactivate my online banking. At this point I had already transferred USD XXXX to the account. 

HSBC communicated the closure to me a few weeks after the account opening ( end of XXXX ). Since this time ( 3-4 months ago ) I am trying to get my money back. I have not received any communication from HSBC that would talk about how to get my money back or that HSBC is working on it. I received a check for USD XXXX mid XXXX ( it wasnt communicated what this was for but I assume this was interest ). 

Since XXXX, I have contacted the HSBC customer service team many times, last time about 4-5 weeks ago. The only communication I received from them is that they cant help me as another team is responsible. This team would not take any customer calls.",,5993747

I used their payday loan service and often tracked my spending on the XXXX version of their app as I own all XXXX devices. I was mostly satisfied with their services until I tried to buy a home. Two days before closing on the intended home the FHA loan underwriter requested an official account statement from Brigit to ensure that I did not owe a balance to the company or that I was repaying the payday loan as outlined by the agreement between Brigit and I. After searching the app and the official Brigit website I could not find a source to procure an official account statement or any other documentation that could satisfy the requirements to be accepted by the FHA loan office. I reached out to Brigit via their email as their website declared that their preferred method of contact for customer support. I was emailed back the following day a person named XXXX whom I can only assume must be employed at Brigit as a customer service agent as she did not disclose her title within the company. XXXX stated that Brigit was not a bank and thus not obligated to provide me with an account statement. I immediately replied to XXXX 's email asking if there was any other official documentation that could prove any good standing between Brigit and myself. My replay has been left unanswered for over a business day and still has yet to be answered. This caused me to look for other resources and my discovery of CFPB and the XXXX XXXX. After this research I reached back out to Brigit by replying to XXXX 's email again informing her of the information I had gathered and if I was not properly assisted in a proper time frame and if Brigit was not going to comply with US Federal law I would be reporting the company to CFPB and seeking legal action.

Billing disputes,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, Paypal paid a XXXX $ XXXX dollar civil penalty along with a designated XXXX $ XXXX customer refund fee due to alleged deceptive business practices within its Bill Me Later/Credit option. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I made a XXXX $ payment to paypal with what I believed to be a possible MasterCard/Visa, ending in XXXX and XXXX respectively. At first I was given the option to use the Bill Me Later, and i clicked No and continued with my card. I tried one or two more times before realizing on-site malfunctions would not allow that payment method, although there was no issue on my end. I read the terms and service of Bill Me Later, noting that I would receive a XXXX $ credit refund, and that the XXXX $ would be charged and payed off XXXX month after the initial payment date. I clicked to use the card anyway after refreshing the page countless times, and eventually it went through. I had a feeling it enrolled me with credit, but had no way of knowing at the time. On XXXX XXXX, I received a XXXX $ late fee followed by the option to pay an additional {$0.00} interest charge to avoid standard/deferred interest on the payment. I received additional late fees/interest charges as follows : XXXX XXXX : {$35.00} ; {$2.00} XXXX XXXX : {$35.00} ; {$2.00} and XXXX XXXX : {$35.00} ; {$2.00}. I called around XX/XX/XXXX after noticing these charges, although I received no email, phone, mail or on-site notifications, to the credit line of Paypal via a listed phone number from the site. The first woman I spoke with, before letting me explain my situation, removed some late fees in an overzealous manner, informing me to call back after I received permission from the cardholder to give the card number over the phone. She said it had to be done to remove late fees, and by contacting paypal, and not the credit company I was speaking with, I would disqualify myself from that option. However late fees and interest charges were still applied for that month and furthermore. I called back to inquire about why those were the circumstances and why I was still responsible for paying the initial XXXX {$.00} I received no help and was told that because I ( the paypal acc owner ) told them that I was not the cardholder, that they would need to speak to him directly, and were locking me out of any further maintenance to the account. However, my father ( the cardholder ) was not comfortable giving that information over the phone, and was more so skeptical of the matter itself, which leads me here. As of today, XXXX/XXXX/15, my owed total for credit is {$110.00}. I was told by the CFPB that they would contact me if I was eligible for compensation regarding this issue, however I believe I have been affected by the following, directly relevant to the lawsuit Paypal participated in : Abusively charged consumers deferred interest ; Deceptively advertised promotional benefits ; Enrolled consumers in PayPal Credit without their knowledge or consent ; Made consumers use PayPal Credit for purchases instead of their preferred payment method ; Engaged in illegal billing practices ; Mishandled consumer disputes about payments.I am worried that this entire debacle will impact my credit, cause undeserving financial issues, and impair the functionality of my account, seeing as I 'm in the process of linking my bank account. 
Attached are screenshots of all necessary and relevant files, such as evidence of abusive interest, continued late fees even after removing them *in what I BELIEVE to be an effort to bury the dispute and avoid the lawsuit charges*, along with paypal credit statements, credit transaction history, and an informative on the deferred interest policy along with a credit summary.

This is predatory lending!!! 

I was taken fully advantage of with this bait and switch tactic. I borrowed {$1000.00} and have repaid {$440.00}. I have {$550.00} remaining to repay what I borrowed. 

On XXXX XXXX, I submitted a complaint demanding that CreditNinja agree to new payment terms of {$50.00} per month paid via check for 12 months for a total of {$600.00} bringing my total payments to {$1000.00}.

Can't repay my loan,The terms of my private student loan with BECU were changed without my knowledge. When I began paying back my student loans XXXX have never missed a payment ) in XX/XX/XXXX I had up to XXXX XXXX month forbearance periods available to me. In XX/XX/XXXX I became unemployed and reached out to my lending institution letting them know that I would like to opt for the XXXX month forbearance available to me. They told me that they were no longer offering these forbearance periods and I would need to figure out how to pay. For XXXX months I barely made my payments of {$600.00} per month on unemployment checks ; until I was lucky enough to find employment again. I feel violated by those periods of forbearance being taken away from me.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I took out a loan on my XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX with Express Check Advance for the total of {$1200.00}. The pay back amount was {$1400.00}. During the course of signing I questioned XXXX XXXX, the manager who drew out the loan, multiple times regarding the payment method for the loan. Before signing, I asked her multiple times if loan amount would decrease with each payment I made and I told her that I was only interested in the loan if there was a set number of monthly payments until it was paid in full. She reassured me multiple times that there would only be monthly payments, that I would not have to pay it all back at once. My mother, who witnessed her telling me this after she had came outside to take photographs of the car, asked the same question I had asked and was told the exact same thing. After telling me what my monthly payment would be, she told me I would have somewhere between 11 and 12 payments After paying four months into the loan, I started questioning why the remaining balance was not decreasing, and spoke with the agent XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX asking her why the balance was not decreasing like the manager XXXX XXXX told me it would be. XXXX informed me that what XXXX told me was incorrect, that the payments I was making would never decrease the total loan amount. She told me in her own words that I would never be through paying for the car unless it was paid all at once. I informed XXXX that this was not what the manager XXXX XXXX had told me and explained to me when I was signing the paperwork for the loan. Following this matter I and my mother called corporate and have spoken multiple times with the regional manager XXXX XXXX regarding the loan. My mother verified everything that XXXX XXXX had told us regarding the loan. XXXX, upon speaking with her, stated to me and my mother that XXXX was no longer with them, that she had been fired for fraudulently having me enter into a contract. The regional manager XXXX XXXX confirmed with my mother that she had to let go of XXXX XXXX because of the contract that my mother and I see that I was scammed with fraud and false pretense of gain for Express Check Advance 's profit. I was mislead and taken advantage of trusting Express Check Advance and the store manager XXXX XXXX to be honest and upfront with me, believing her to be true. XXXX XXXX 's word should have been bond as legal and binding, but instead I was mislead with fiery lies and deceit because it was the first title loan I have ever done. I was deceived by manipulation and false statements into entering a contract with Express Check Advance whom by which I was taken advantage of. I have already paid {$660.00} from the total of {$1400.00} cent. I should only owe {$770.00}, based on the explanation of XXXX XXXX while I was signing the loan, should be the remaining balance owed on the loan.

XXXX can be reached at ( XXXX ) XXXX. 

Today on XX/XX/XXXX my mother and I called Express Check Advance asking for a payoff amount and XXXX gave her the amount of {$770.00}. After receiving the payoff amount, I went to XXXX. Over the phone, XXXX gave sales agent a 21 day payoff amount of {$1400.00}. I told her over the phone that that was not what she told me the pay off amount was earlier today and she started talking about added interests among other things. She also spoke with myself and sales agent XXXX very rudely. My mother and I have complained about XXXX 's attitude multiple times with XXXX XXXX as well. So to keep from dealing with XXXX 's attitude, we called XXXX XXXX at XXXX telling her about XXXX XXXX nasty attitude and the way she talked to people, and asking for the correct payoff amount from XXXX XXXX directly. My mother and I informed and asked XXXX XXXX if the payoff amount we were told originally, of {$770.00}, was correct and she said yes. After speaking with her, we called XXXX back at Express Check Advance telling her we had spoken with XXXX XXXX. XXXX was very rude again so we hung up and called XXXX XXXX back at XXXX. We told her how nasty XXXX 's attitude was and that we were just calling to get the payoff amount because we kept getting different payoff amounts, which we were mislead into this fraudulent contract from the beginning by Express Check Advance 's manager XXXX XXXX. At XXXX we received a phone call from XXXX XXXX telling us that the payoff amount was {$1000.00} which we informed her was not what she told us at XXXX XXXX today.

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"I want to make a general complaint about a disturbing trend among large U.S. banks most notably XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and Citigroup which are reportedly using their enormous market power to discriminate against their customers who conduct lawful firearm-related business activities protected under the Second Amendment to the US Constitution. 

These banks seem to be making political statements and using social engineering to act against law abiding citizens by withholding access to credit to customers and companies they disfavor. 

There is also reason to believe that these banks may be using their collection of personally identifiable information ( PII ) to monitor and deny financial services to individuals and companies who are engaging in completely legal and Constitutionally-protected activity. 

As a consumer of firearms and related products, I am very concerned about XXXX and Citigroups antigun discrimination. 

Every American adult likely uses or will need banking services to survive in our modern economy. Law-abiding gun owners have legitimate concerns about possible collusion and collective efforts between banks and/or banks and political advocacy groups aimed at denying them services simply for exercising their rights under the U.S. Constitution and laws. 

These efforts also can create a hostile and chilling climate for the exercise of Second Amendment rights, particularly for those hoping to obtain financing for such things as home and auto purchases or running a small business. Once financial institutions take it upon themselves to set social policy that exceeds the requirements of the law, its impossible to know where they will stop or what other indicators of disfavored activity might become relevant to them. No American should be treated as a scapegoat for someone elses crimes. 

We taxpayers footed the bill in billions of tax dollars to help bail out these financial behemoths after the banks reckless business practices brought their companies and the U.S. economy to the brink of disaster. 

Citigroup  received nearly half a trillion dollars in taxpayer-backed guarantees and cash after putting the entire financial system at risk. It was the largest government bailout in American history. 

Citigroups new firearm policies run counter to laws and regulations passed by Congress, and they infringe and discriminate against an individuals Second Amendment rights.

These bank policies should not be endorsed by our federal government. Our government should only do business with companies that respect all of our constitutional rights, including the Second Amendment. 

We need to know more about these banks restrictive firearm policies and any other legal transactions, industries, and businesses they disfavor, prohibit, or boycott. 

I urge you to investigate the business practices of these banks to root out unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. Please monitor these financial giants for risks to law abiding consumers engaged in lawful commerce for our Constitutionally-protected Second Amendment activities.

Fraud or scam,"I made a purchase of a smartphone which I never received. I had used PayPal to make that purchase just in case things went wrong because they have a buyer protection program.

I even went as far as having verifiable representatives of USPS send me written notice that the package was mishandled and misdelivered.

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"I took out a payday loan with 605 Lending ( FSST Management Services , LLC, d/b/a 605 Lending (  referred hereinafter as 605 Lending, LLC ) ) for the amount of {$500.00} after experiencing an emergency. At the time, I was asked to call to complete the loan process where they say their script on the contract, outlining that the agreement I was to be spent should be signed online to complete the process. All this time, the person who is handling my case is providing me with an overview about the interest minimally -- as in the rates are stated on the agreement that they then asked me to sign and submit while they were on the phone with me. I did not have a chance to go through the exact fine print or terms, but was able to see the percentages at the top and the amount owed. They also said that I was to make payments for the next 12 months bi weekly as per my pay schedule, and I went through and logged each upcoming pay date. They also showed via the page I was provided that the loan would be charging an AYP of what at the time I thought was 440 %. Very expensive but being desperate and pressured I signed and received the funds. Later, I was able to log into the account and reread the loan terms but noticed there was a higher interest rate than I previously saw at over 775.96 % and each payment would be {$150.00}, making the loan well over the originally borrowed {$500.00}. I paid as the terms were outlined though unhappily, especially since no one covered nor is it stated how the principal amount would be payed using my payments. As time moved forward and a few payments were made I had a few issues with early payment processing and subsequent overdrafts on my end and asked the company to switch from ACH debit via writing/ email. They agreed, but sent a LONG email with a gist of "" Remember to follow the terms YOU signed and pay this loan, etc. '' which I understood and said thank you for. In this same email I saw that they were then asking that I send my payment or call in for payment 3 DAYS PRIOR to my original due date and that if i did not I was by proxy allowing for them to sign a check in my name for the amounts owed. I declined and called them asking to make sure they knew not only was this not acceptable but unwelcome. I also said that I would not pay until my due date which is my right as the consumer but was met with the same "" Follow your agreement '' line. I again stated this was not acceptable and again tried to reach out where I was again met with opposition. Upon further reading the agreement, they have a section labeled under the ACH/ Debit section stating that as the signee I "" may not revoke the authorization to prepare and submit drafts on my behalf until such times as the loan is paid in full ''. Under thisclause is then another clause stating another payment option called a "" REMOTELY CREATED CHECK ( RCC ) AUTHORIZATION '' and is outlined as such : "" If you elect to make your payments by remotely created check ( otherwise known as a demand, draft, XXXX, preauthorized draft or paper draft ), then by electronically signing this Payment Authorization Agreement you authorize Lender to create checks bearing your name and other information as may be required under applicable law, rather than your handwritten signature, drawn on your bank account below, and to submit each check for payment to your bank or financial institution ( Remotely Created Check ) in the amount of each payment due, under the payment schedule or otherwise to Lender under this Agreement or any amount on any dates on which you and Lender later agree. 
If a remotely Created Check is returned unpaid by your bank or financial institution, then you authorize Lender to create and submit a Remotely Created Check for any late fees or other amounts accrued pursuant to this Agreement. You agree that your typed name or other designation mandated by applicable law will constitute your authorized signature fully reflecting your intent to authenticate any such Remotely Created Check.

Trouble using your card,"We paid off the entire balance ( around {$4200.00} ) on our UNITED/Chase credit card on XX/XX/XXXX because we are traveling abroad and wanted to have the full card limit available ( {$5000.00} ). 

The funds were withdrawn from our bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. The new balance on the credit card account reflects that new balance ( around {$200.00} ). On XX/XX/XXXX we called Chase Card Services because the card did not work at the hotel reception. We were told that there is a 6 day hold until the funds become available on XX/XX/2023. 

We requested a partial release of the funds to be able to pay the hotel but the person we talked to ( XXXX-did not provide last name ) kept repeating the same and claimed he was the manager. 

It is not acceptable that a bank or credit card provider sits on our money for 6 days before releasing it. It does not take 6 days to make a bank transfer from a checking account to a credit card provider, when it takes 1 day for an average person to do so. 

We have had this card for over 20 years now and will most likely close the credit card account after this exchange.",,6844005

Problem when making payments,"My payments come out biweekly on the XXXX and the XXXX of the month in the amount of {$50.00} by ACH withdrawal. On XX/XX/XXXX, I accessed their website and my account and paid the XX/XX/XXXX payment via ACH that day. The XXXX  payment cleared my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. However, another ACH debit in the amount of {$50.00} was taken out of my bank account again on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called the company, they stated it was because it takes 3 to 10 business days for payments to clear, so they also took out the prescheduled payment of the XXXX also. They then said that once the payment on the XXXX clears, it will be applied to the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the one they withdrew on the XXXX would be applied to the payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. I repeatedly told them they did a 2nd withdraw from my account without my permission and demanded they stop the withdraw or refund my money. They repeatedly told me they had no way to do either and that the 2nd payment would be applied to the XX/XX/XXXX payment date. I talked to 4 reps and got conflicting information. They tried to backtrack when I threatened them with legal action and said that they could consider the payment on the XXXX as an extra payment ... even though they admitted to withdrawing the same payment 2 times. The last rep I talked to said that they could indeed refund one of those payments but not until they both cleared. If the 2nd withdrawn on the XXXX will not clear for 3 to 10 business days, what is the guarantee that the same thing will not happen on the XXXX? I advised that since they did not offer a solution and they repeatedly gave conflicting information, that I would be contacting all agencies that regulate their business and pursuing legal action. I have screenshots of the last 2 conversations as the 1st two were by phone. However, Acima does advise that they are recording their calls.

Problem when making payments,"I made a purchase with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX of this year. Rather than use my credit card to make the purchase of {$1900.00}, I took advantage of their 18 Months Deferred Interest offer to use XXXX  's credit card.

I received my order in a timely manner and the goods were not damaged in any way. 

In late XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX regarding payment. They notified me that I was 30 days past due. I apologized and promised payment when I did my bills for XXXX. I asked at that time how much was due. The amount stated was {$140.00}. Shortly thereafter, I received an actual bill from XXXX   with the amount due at {$140.00} I authorized payment through my bank on XX/XX/XXXX for {$150.00} ; my bank processed the check on XX/XX/XXXX and the check arrived at XXXX 's PO Box on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received another bill from XXXX XXXX/XXXX. The billing cycle had ended on XX/XX/XXXX and no payment had posted. I checked my bank and no check has cleared though they had tracked the payment as received in XXXX XXXX at the creditor 's PO Box . 

I called XXXX XXXX thereafter to discuss the matter this morning. I was asked for my account number, which is NOT plainly indicated on the statement, and shared with no less than 4 people the situation that I needed to resolve. I was also informed on this call that I should have received a welcome packet with my first bill, of which I did not. While on the phone with XXXX, I was told the only way I could resolve this issue was to set up an account online so that I could communicate with them and share my bank documentation. To resolve this issue will take 48 hours or more as the people responsible for receiving and posting payments are not customer-facing employees. 

Upon closer inspection of the bill I received today, XXXX has charged me a {$38.00} late fee and {$2.00} Interest Charge. Please remember that my purchase was supposed to be interest-free for 18 months. 

I also called XXXX Customer Service today and explained that I believed their Credit Card partner to be somewhat dishonest and not helpful in resolving the situation. 

This afternoon, I received TWO credit alerts that XXXX/XXXX has reported that I have newly reported delinquencies on my credit report. Now I will be forced to fight credit bureaus with this situation so it does not impact my credit score.

It seems to me that XXXX XXXX   is attempting to earn additional fees by 1 ) not sending my first statement, 2 ) charging Late Fees when payment has been made, 3 ) collecting interest that is not due or causing my payment to be late so that they can skirt the terms of the agreement that I made with XXXX to make timely payments in exchange for 18 months Interest-Free financing.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"In the Wells Fargo response to CFPB complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX "" on XX/XX/XXXX, we received returned mail and we suppressed statements for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX XXXX alleges no communication took place over those same months in his XXXX XX/XX/XXXX response to an inquiry from my State 's Office of the Attorney General, claiming that WF has no record of call communication from me after XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. This is misleading as my accounts were placed into a deferment on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and I'd been filing complaints and receiving responses to billing errors since around XXXX of XXXX -- to which WF responded. All of this is important because XXXX XXXX claims in XXXX that statements were withheld from me ( unlawfully ) and that my right of notice was only re-enabled once I confirmed my address in XX/XX/XXXX. The XX/XX/XXXX time-frame seems rather arbitrary and odd. What DID take place on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX is a Wells Fargo soft inquiry on my credit files. Attached is the inquiry from XXXX. Considering the timing of the soft inquiry, it appears to be an inquiry conducted in a similar manner to what a debt collector would do in order to find/contact/mail a collection notice. The point is I did nothing between the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to warrant that should have prevented me from receiving a statement.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"My university uses ECSI as a loan servicer. The servicer 's repayment process on their website is very difficult to navigate. I pay all of my bills online, including a student loan from a different servicer, and ECSI is the only one that I feel is intentionally trying to scam people into not making payments or being charged fees to make a payment. 

The whole issue with ECSI stems from having to navigate through a convoluted process to set up a payment schedule. In my situation, I attempted to make a payment several months before my deferment period was over. 

The process began like this : First, the option to make a payment was not given. After searching the site you figure out that you need to go through a separate process to add a checking account to your loan account so that the payment can be withdrawn from it. 

Second, once the checking account is added, you are given a few options to pay your loan i.e. via checking account, credit card, etc. A problem here is that XXXX of the payment options are identical except XXXX charges you a transaction fee while the other is free. These XXXX payment options both withdraw from your checking account. If you select the wrong option you may be directed to the process where you will need to pay a fee just to pay off your loan. 

Third, once you select the free option to pay by direct debit ( checking account ) you select your loan balance that you want the payment applied to. Here, I elected to make a {$700.00} payment. After inputting {$700.00}, you need to hit the "" apply '' button. I think this button tells the system that you really do want to make a {$700.00} payment. 

Fourth, after you hit apply, you now need to check off on the boxes "" below ''. Here, I agreed to the terms of use. Then I checked a second box where I was telling the system that I wanted my payment to be withdrawn/applied to my loan on a specific date and then selected the date I preferred. 

Fifth, I clicked confirm and received a confirmation page that my payment will be applied on the date selected. 

The problem arises in the fourth step. There 's another box that I needed to select. This box generally says that I would like my payment applied in periods of deferment or when payment is not required by me. So, even though I went through all of the steps telling the system I really want to make a payment and I want this payment applied on a particular day, none of it made any difference because I did n't select the XXXX box asking to apply payment when payment is not required. I even was taken to a confirmation page that showed my payment set up was a success but it never really was a "" success '' because ECSI intentionally made the process convoluted. 

I was lucky to catch this during my deferment period. There has to be many situations where people paying off their student loans post-deferment encountered the difficulties of the ECSI payment process and ended up being slapped with late fees and such.",,1827519

Also, I wanted to see if I could set up a payment plan so that I could pay a lesser payment while I get back on my feet. I have had friends that had similar situations with cash 1 in the past and they were allowed to set up a different payment plan and take off automatic draft. Even a week ago I had a friend that did. Cash one said they can not take of automatic draft and that I could only pay the installment loan full amount an nothing would be allowed. Please do not do business with this company because they will not work with you if something ever happens to you, even though they have done it for other people. I have never had any problems like this before, and am very disappointed in a company that I once had the uptmost trust in. This is not fair treatment. Two weeks ago I canceled my automatic drafts with my bank since I ca n't through cash one and wo n't be able to pay anything since they will not allow me to set up a payment plan for a lesser amount. Friday, I looked at my bank account and noticed they withdrew {$150.00} out of my account even though I called my bank and stopped the automatic drafts. Yesterday, when I called my bank they said that the original time cash one tried to draft the payment it did not go through. So my bank said cash one changed their numbers around to try to draft the money out of my account until it worked. My bank tried to stop it after it started processing but could not. They said it was taken out. I want to take off automatic draft and to make payments in smaller increments and pay it off but I do not know what to believe anymore. Please be aware of this company if something ever happens.",,2733598
Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Sheffield Financial regarding a recent transaction and their negligent miscommunication and breach of duty of care. I kindly request your assistance in conducting an investigation into this matter and seeking a resolution that upholds consumer rights and protects against deceptive practices. 

I provide the following details related to my complaint : Background Information : Date of initial loan agreement with Sheffield Financial : XX/XX/XXXX Loan account number : XXXX Description of the transaction : I financed a motorcycle purchase through Sheffield Financial with the understanding that the loan would be paid in full upon receipt of an XXXX  transfer from the buyer. The buyer took possession of the motorcycle based on Sheffield Financials ' communication on XX/XX/XXXX that if I did not hear back from them by XX/XX/XXXX that the check had cleared and I was "" good to go '', I was informed by the bank that "" no news was good news '' and any reasonable person would have believed that they were telling me that I was safe to hand over the motorcycle to the buyer.

Timeline of Events : XX/XX/XXXX : Loan agreement signed with Sheffield Financial. 

XX/XX/XXXX : ACH transfer from the buyer was submitted and deposited. Sheffield Financial informed me directly on a recorded call that "" no news was good news '' and that I would only hear from them if the check bounces, and that if I did not hear from them by XX/XX/XXXX then that means the check most likely cleared. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Based on my recorded discussions with Sheffield Financial and information they provided to me, I handed over the motorcycle to the buyer thinking everything was ok. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I logged onto my Sheffield Financial account and saw that the check had seemingly bounced, no one from the bank contacted me at all to notify what had happened, I had to call them to understand. This was after them telling me on XX/XX/XXXX that "" no news was good news ''. The buyer committed fraud and neither sending or receiving bank has given me any information how they were both fooled by a scam artist that was either using fake or stolen information to submit a {$10000.00} ACH transfer to purchase this bike from me. There is an active investigation in process by the XXXX Police Department here in Florida. This is a case of Grand Theft Auto by Fraud and potential Identify Theft. Neither bank protected me, and my bank ( Sheffield Financial ) breached their duty of care and misled me into thinking I was ok to give the buyer the bike on XX/XX/XXXX. They have given me no indication as to what went wrong and instead are blaming me for giving the buyer the bike. Even the local police department admitted that the bank has to take some liability in this case, and they even advised me to sue Sheffield Financial in this instance. Sheffield Financial will not let me have any information from any of the recorded calls and are blaming the vicitim leaving me on the hook to pay back {$10000.00} for the remaining balance of the loan on a bike that was stolen. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Contacted by Sheffield Financial, stating that their internal investigation concluded that I am still responsible for the loan balance. They argued that they did not specifically tell me the check had cleared but instead said "" at this point the check has not bounced ''. Ignoring the fact that on XX/XX/XXXX they told me "" No news was good news '' and that I would only hear from them IF the check bounces, and that if I don't hear back by XX/XX/XXXX that means the check most likely cleared. They told me on a recorded call that it was safe to wait till that date to hand over the bike. They blamed me, took zero responsibility and have provided me with no information on what went wrong and how they and the sending bank were both fooled. 

I truly believe that this is a case of Negligent Misrepresentation and Breach of Duty of care. Any Reasonable Person would have taken what the bank told me and translated that as being safe to give the buyer the motorcycle on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please let me know if any further information or documentation is required from my end to facilitate the investigation. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt response. 

Thank you for your assistance in this regard. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,7237953
Opening an account,"I opened a checking and savings acccount with Chase after I received an offer for {$600.00} when I ( 1 ) fund the savings account with XXXX Dollars and keep it there for 90 days ; ( 2 ) Make direct deposit from employer within 90 days and. 

I made the savings deposit and I directed my employer to make direct deposit after 40 days ( I only received my checking account number and card after 2 weeks - so there was a natural delay in getting this established ). Given my payment intervals this would mean that the payment would go through 61 days or so after the account was opened. 

However, Chase closed the checking account after 60 days ( due to XXXX balance ). My direct deposit therefore didn't succeed. 

This was nowhere mentioned in the rules nor at the branch when I talked to an employee who restated the rules to me. He assured me that if I start the direct deposit then everything is fine. 

Without the account open I will not qualify for the promotion plus I spent many hours having my employer pay me after the direct deposit went nowhere.",,6812098
Trouble using your card,"When I opened accounts with Capital One Bank, Capital One had incentives like balance Transfers, or low interest on purchases etc. I used my accounts, paid them off to a XXXX balance and earned an {$30000.00} credit limit. on account ending in XXXX. This account was not used for a while. Capital One sent me a notice that they wanted me to use this credit card account. When I tried to use this account to make purchases and this credit account was declined several times. I then contacted Capital one and their representatives told me that there are restrictions limiting the use of this account. Then there was a security breach on the account, restricting me further. Capital one then lowers the credit limits from {$30000.00} to {$10000.00} credit limit. I then received a red flag from XXXX ( XXXX ) telling me that Capital One had a security breach. I then received XXXX notices from Capital one ( crediXXXX Wise ) that my credit scores have changed from all three bureaus, losing several credit score points from each onXXXX. This happened all because of Capital one lowering my credit limit from {$30000.00} to {$10000.00}. It seems that the more business I gave Capital one the more they punish t me.

Fees or interest,"I opened an Ann Taylor credit card several years ago. I had not used it in a couple of years when I used it in XXXX. Because I had not used it in years, the bank who issued the card, Comenity Bank, did not have my current address. 

They began calling me several times a day in XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a man there in XXXX and he explained I recently used the card and did not make my payment. I asked him why I had not received a bill. We realized they did not have my latest address. I updated my address with him and asked him to send me the bill and I would pay it. I also closed the account that day. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I began receiving several phone calls a day from Comenity Bank again. I asked why they had not sent me a bill yet. I did not receive an answer but was told to pay the balance of {$190.00}. 

Since I had the account information in my online bank settings, I paid the balance and thought I was done. Even though I still had not received a bill. I paid this balance on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In late XX/XX/XXXX I started receiving five phone calls a day from Comenity Bank, these calls would interrupt me in work meetings several times a day, I would receive phone calls late into the evening and all throughout the weekends. A message was never left in my voicemail. I did not know what it was about since I had paid the balance off and closed the account. 

I answered the call one day on a Sunday when I had received several calls throughout the weekend. When I answered it, I was told by a recorded voice to call back during business hours Monday through Friday. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I answered another one of the calls. A woman told me I had a balance due. she asked for my address, which I gave her and she confirmed she had the correct address. I asked why she has not sent me any bills when I have been asking for a bill since XX/XX/XXXX. She said she could not tell me anything further unless I provided my social security number and date of birth. I told her I would not provide my PII on a recorded line and that she called me.

Payoff process,"Capital One Bank ( USA ) , N.A . ( "" the Bank '' ) is engaging in unfair, deceptive, abusive acts and practices by violating my rights under the account holder agreement for my Capital One Visa Platinum account. I recently relocated to a new state and updated my billing information with the Bank. Apparently this modification triggered a fraud alert in their system, which prevents me from accessing any account information ; information I need to remit payments and review ( 1 ) my balance, ( 2 ) account activity, including debits and credits, and ( 3 ) a copy of my rights under the account holder agreement. At the encouragement of the Bank, I foolishly enrolled in online statements, I do n't receive paper statements regularly. As a result, this system that is now prohibiting my access is my only source of this data. 

While I am not particularly concerned about ever using this account to make purchases again, I believe that Capital One is violating a number of consumer protection laws by not sharing my current balance or transaction data with me until I produce an onerous amount of documentation to prove who I am ( apparently the multiple telephone identity verification processes and desire to pay my bill are not sufficient proof of who I am ). The Bank does not have the authority to make such a demand or, if they do, I would n't know because I am unable to access a copy of my account holder agreement to review my rights. 

A large bank like Capital One should know that there are many identity verification services such as XXXX XXXX or even the USPS change of address system that would provide ample proof to the Bank of who I am and that I relocated. 

This action may be pervasive and affecting consumers at large. I encourage the CFPB to issue a Civil Investigatory Demand ( CID ) to the Bank to determine whether or not this is a widespread issue. This fraud block prevents a consumer from accessing information needed in order to pay their bill, potentially causing severe harm to consumers. I believe that this demonstrates, at best, willful neglect on the part of Capital One Bank who would certainly continue to charge additional interest and late penalties, furnish data to credit reporting agencies or charge off this account should I fail to remit regular payment on this account. 

Other, more responsible financial institutions, have implemented effective alternative methods to ensure that accounts with suspected fraudulent activity do not incur additional charges while still allowing the account holder to access relevant data about their account. 

I was able to obtain an unverified total current balance from the fraud manager who I spoke with after I was told it was a violation of their policy/procedure to provide this information to me. I have remitted a payment for this full amount to the Bank, although I have not had an opportunity to review the transactions which make up this balance.",,1997036

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"I have made between 11 and 12 years of payments on this loan. Yesterday, my cosigner was advised in that many years, less than {$1000.00} has come off of the principle of the loan. The loan was originally {$8000.00}. Yesterday, my cosigner was told I still owe them {$7400.00}. I feel like I am dealing with a loan shark. 
I don't even make {$40000.00} a year and give them what I can. I tried to get the cosigner removed and since I didn't make any payments the first year of the pandemic, and not being told that loan didn't qualify for no payments, they have marked my credit report in a negative way. I am happy to send a copy of the ledger of my payments. I will provide any identifying information you need to investigate this situation. 
This is holding up a mortgage loan for my cosigner. In fact, AES made him pay them {$150.00} yesterday! I have paid them over {$250.00} since XX/XX/XXXX because I borrowed money from my sister to be able to do so. Again, I make less than {$40000.00} per year, and my husband is XXXX and on Social Security. The way this is going, I will end up paying on an {$8000.00} loan longer than I will pay for my mortgage ( 15 years ). 

I have made the payments, and more than requested for a number of years. At the time when I could pay more money, I talked to someone at AES, on a recorded line, to ensure me that the extra money would go towards the principle. They agreed, yet evidently that was not the case. 

I also have federal student loans that I have not been able to pay on because I have been paying AES all these years. The interest rates on the student loans, most of which are from XXXX, I think I have around {$200000.00} of federal student loan debt that is at least 50 % interest.

Billing disputes,"I rented a house using my credit card through the XXXX website. There were problems as soon as I arrived, beginning with the fact that there was no connection to the internet. I worked with the owner and repair crew over three days to try to fix the internet issue as well as numerous other issues with the house such as 1. no heat -- house at constant XXXX degrees fahrenheit 2. insufficient electrical service to house to allow functioning of household appliances such as dryer or washer or jacuzi tub, electric broiler. 
3. Leaky roof ( leaked water onto living room floor ) 4. Hot water supply tube under kitchen sink leaked water onto kitchen floor creating a puddle and underside of sink covered with black mold creating a potential health hazard The evening of the third night the hot water ran out and since there was still no internet the next morning I sent the owner an email that I was leaving. The owner acknowledged that she was sorry that I was leaving and asked me where the keys were. I told her and left the property. 
The original charges were {$150.00} security deposit to be returned upon receipt of unharmed property at termination of rental and {$640.00} rental charges etc which included taxes and fees. I arrived on the XXXX in the afternoon and left on the morning of the XXXX. 
The amount of communications between myself and the owner is voluminous. The credit card company has not taken the time to read it in its entirety. Many of the statements made by the owner following my departure are not in agreement with those made beforehand. 
I discussed the problems with XXXX and asked for their advice during several telephone calls in the first few days. XXXX took no responsibility and insisted that the homeowner had discretion to refund my fees at any time. The owner had "" warned '' me that my "" window '' for cancellation was going to pass. This is not what XXXX claimed. I wanted to stay and resolve the problems but the house became uninhabitable with the cessation of hot water and continued problems with the internet. After my departure I called the credit card company and described the problems and stated that I wished for my money to be returned as the house was not as described and had no heat or hot water.

Opening an account,"Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of  information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me.

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",,3489572

Managing an account,"XXXX XXXX - Filing this on behalf of my brother who does not use technology. 

XXXX XXXX story : It starts with XXXX having an emergency fund passbook account which was opened with XXXX XXXX XXXX with last transition in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with a balance of {$14000.00}. He used the account only for special items like trips to XXXX to visit our parent and it was not used in a long time because they passed away now for 20 years. He has lived in the same residence for 35 years and has never received any mail regarding his account changing and has been going to the same branch for 35 years at XXXX XXXX. BY law since the account was dormant with no transactions he should have been notified by mail or phone, but he was not. I did check to see if it was turned over to NY State in their database, but nothing there. You may not be aware but XXXX XXXX was merged with XXXX and then the branches in the area where acquired by XXXX XXXX which was then acquired by Key Bank. He is also having an issue with a {$30000.00} CD from XXXX which was never cashed. The CD is currently being investigated by NY state. 

In XXXX of XXXX he went to the same branch which he always did in the past now is key bank, presented his passbook and withdraw {$2000.00}. His XXXX XXXX statement showed {$6000.00} before the withdrawal in XXXX. XXXX went back in XXXX XXXX to make another withdrawal and they told him his account was was closed with no funds. He spoke to the branch manager and asked how that can happen. He was to trusting and provided her with the account statement because she told him that is the only way she could get his money back. He should have her make copies. He waited and waited and nothing happened. There were three {$1000.00} dollar withdrawals prior to the XXXX withdrawal and the writing did not look like his at all. He went back to the branch and filled a police report. He went back several times and she said she was working on it. She kept showing him and asking him if that was his drivers license number which the bank has on file. Of course he said yes. 

I finally stepped in around XXXX and contact the branch manager who did not return my calls. I called customer service ask for area branch manager to escalate her. Customer Service got her on the phone after my escalation comment. I asked her what is going on with my brothers account this should have been resolved in XXXX. She said we are retrieving the video and it has taken longer. I provided my phone number and asked her to call be back in a week, but never heard back from her. I called again and spoke to one of the tellers and she said she was doing an interview. I never heard back from her. 

I called the fraud line for Key Bank in XXXX who sent out an alert and asked it be routed to the XXXX XXXX branch. It was XXXX XXXX who was much more cooperative. We did a few visits with him and he provided copies of the transaction which I have copies of them. The interesting part is the one he signed for in XXXX XXXX looked very different then the three {$1000.00} withdrawals before the account was closed. One signature started the B in his last name as an O and then wrote over top of it to make it a B. I asked XXXX do these look different to you and he respond yes they do. He worked with the department to track down more information and try to retrieve the video from the branch stored in XXXX XXXX. When I spoke to him in early XXXX he said you are not going to like what I am going to tell you. He said they cant find more information. I asked how is it possible no video with my brother at the teller line making these transactions unacceptable. I need to escalate to the area branch manager who basically said I have to call Key Bank XXXX Client Relationship Department. I had two 3 way calls with my brother on the line. The last one discussion with XXXX she tried to get me out of the mix. 

I contact the FDIC to see what they had to say about there involvement, He said they were not involved in any of those mergers and could not help me. He suggested I file a complaint to the Consumer Protection Agency which is now in process. 

I firmly believe this was fraud and an inside job within XXXX XXXX within the branch or general bank and Key Bank did poor job retaining records. I also believe this expands way beyond XXXX account too many other Seniors that have accounts that were not used very much over the years. With the bank continuing to defer the issue I believe many people went away and just accepted it. This is definitely fraud and until I see videos of my brother standing in front of the teller line making all the transaction with time stamps or some other proof I am going to continue even if it take legal action. 

I would appreciate help in looking in to this matter. I cant image how many others have had their money stolen and accounts closed with no FDIC protection.",,2782560

Can't repay my loan,"Hi, my name is XXXX XXXX and I want to file a complaint concerning the day I was bullied by my "" loan servicer '' & company on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On this day, a few days after I was asked what I would do if my family 's wages got garnished because of my inability to pay them, I told them that I could only pay them {$70.00} and that I was willing to pay that amount to them per month. Navient said that {$70.00} was n't an option and that I would either have to set up a monthly payment amount of {$130.00} from that day forward or pay {$200.00} to keep my loan out of pre-default. I pleaded to them that I was only interested in choosing a payment amount that I could maintain monthly, and not revert within months. ( Years earlier I was goaded into aceepting a payment plan with an outrageously large price point in regards to my income ). They said this was the best they could do for me. When I told them that I was only able pay {$70.00} they told me no because it would n't be enough to match their price point and hung up on me. I actually had to call THEM back just to pay them. 

My aunt, who consigned this loan, told me to mail it in to them but I was afraid that it would n't make it to them in time ( because they only count payments on the day it went through, not when it 's dated ), and that they would move my loan to pre-default status. So I called my aunt to explain the current situation with Navient. After the call, she sent me the following text : "" XXXX '' This took an XXXX on me, forcing me to pull money from my other responsibilities to keep the loan out of "" pre-default. '' So I called back and paid the extra {$130.00} with money that I had designated for other bills. This brought the final total to {$200.00} when I actually only had {$70.00}. To this date, we have not resolved this issue. I have had several other experiences with Navient that are similar to this one throughout my business with them, dating back to XXXX.",,2303284

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"Initially a complaint was filed with the XXXX  with no resolution. The XXXX  complaint number is XXXX. This started as a business arrangement amongst three parties. The parties are the contractor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), the financier ( Dividend Finance ), and the consumer ( myself ). It took the contractor XXXX months to provide an install date from XX/XX/2022 to XX/XX/2022. This was despite the contract stating an install date of XX/XX/2022. This was issue number one. Issue number two On XXXX XX/XX/2022, the contractor misrepresented the system 's status and functionality to the financier in order to receive compensation. 
Also, on XXXX XX/XX/2022, via email, I notified the financier the system was not whole and not functioning as intended and that under no uncertain terms should the contractor receive payment. This is when the financier then altered the terms of the arraignment. Instead of exercising a modicum of due diligence and investigating my concerns, the financier released funds to the contractor anyway. Thereby putting the contractor 's interest above the consumer, this action deprived the consumer of equality in this arraignment. On several occasions, I spoke with and emailed the financier 's employees and stressed that they should do more to get the contractor out the correct my system 's issues. They did not do enough. The financier was under the misconception that they could compel the consumer to pay for an inactive system that was not functioning as intended. 
This situation continued for XXXX months and has resulted in Dividend Finance entering negative information on my credit report.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,6711494
Billing disputes,"Wells Fargo Home Projects Visa has repeatedly assessed late fees when payments were made before the due date. Customer service was helpful in resolving this issue in the past and provided direction for how I could avoid the problem in the future ( details below ), but has not agreed to reverse any more late fees despite following their direction. 

The details of the matter regard a period between the due date and the statement closing date. Wells Fargo sets the due date on the XXXX of every month and does not allow any grace period. I have always paid prior to the due date. The statement closing date is on the XXXX though and the problem occurs when a payment is made towards the next statement prior to the closing date of the previous one ( e.g. when payment is made on XXXX XXXX for the statement due XXXX XXXX ). Even though the payment is made in advance of the due date, a late fee is still assessed. This is contradictory especially since there is no grace period i.e. any payment made after a due date should indicate a payment made towards the next statement. 

I have made every effort available to me to accommodate Wells Fargo Home Project Visa 's business practices. A customer service representative directed me not to make payments until the XXXX. Recent events would indicate that this was not correct and another representative informed me that this date can vary. I have also been told from other representatives that many people encounter this problem. Questions about the effect of this problem on my Credit History and Report were also answered unsatisfactorily. The representative stated that the Credit History would not be effected until the account was more than 30 days past due. Unfortunately, after making payments on time since opening the account, Wells Fargo still believes the account to be delinquent.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1767035
Fees or interest,"I have been an Amex cardmember since XXXX  and recently opened a new account. As part of this I assumed that the automatic payment set up on my other card would continue onto my new card. Only after the payment date passed did I learn that this was not the case. On XX/XX/XXXX I called and requested that the late fee be waived for this misunderstanding and this was done. During this call, I was not told that I would be charged interest and that the interest would continue. To date, I was charged {$180.00} in interest fees on XX/XX/XXXX ( with more coming on in XXXX bill ). Had I known that interest would continue to be charged, I could have changed my card usage. 

In a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX, I requested that the exact calculation for how the interest charge was calculated and was told that this is not possible. Without knowing the correct formula with the actual numbers used, I can not know if I am being charged correctly.

Managing the loan or lease,"I have a vehicle loan with First Investors Servicing Corporation ( Lender ). Due to the events of XXXX it had become difficult to maintain my personal liabilities ( bills ) at current and satisfactory status. 

In XXXX of last year, I had reached out to the lender to advise of my plans to make my account current and arrange payment. The agents I spoke with wouldn't indulge any reason as to why the loan was past due, but rather yelled, belittled, and threatened to take my car. They wouldn't entertain a payment arrangement that would satisfy the account the first week of XXXX ( the following month ). I was so upset with the interaction with the agent and her XXXX and scared that my car would be taken away before I could satisfy the account, that I immediately pulled funds from my 401k. Then subsequently paid {$1100.00} in XXXX, by, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Moving forward a few months my payments were scattered, but in XXXX of this year, XXXX I paid {$800.00}. Due to the new year and becoming financially stable, XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX all of my liabilities would be current and in good standing, due to the economic stimulus payment of {$1400.00} being mailed to my on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received an email from the lender on XX/XX/XXXX requesting I contact them. I did so via email, and i received no reply. I am not going to put myself through a battery of XXXX  again by calling them. Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received another email from the lender indicating that I need to contact them ASAP due to the account being past due. The email also indicated that if the account isn't made current "" promptly '', it will be "" escalated '' to enforce the note, and since "" enforcement '' would include "" moving to the pre-repossession stage and then possible repossession of the motor vehicle serving as collateral ''. 

Today, I noticed my car was missing, and my property XXXX didn't tow my car, I called the lender. They indicated to me that the vehicle was repossessed this morning. They have assessed a total charge of {$1900.00}. Charges including {$1100.00} past due amount, {$18.00} late fees, {$730.00} security payments, {$460.00} in repossession fees. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email communication from the lender to contact them due to my account status. I promptly replied to the email seeking resolution, however, the lender never responded. Today XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, I realize my vehicle is missing. After speaking with my residential property XXXX, and they affirmed that they had not towed my vehicle, I immediately contact the lender. The lender informs me that my vehicle was repossessed this morning.

Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"I obtained a credit building loan through XXXX, who immediately gave me {$2000.00} and kept {$3000.00} in a "" secured savings '' until I paid off the loan. They then sold the loan to Systems and Services Technologies , Inc. I paid off the loan on XX/XX/2023 and it has a message stating : "" Recently paid off loan?

I have also emailed them numerous times ( XXXX ) and I get an autoresponse stating to call them. 
After paying off the loan on XX/XX/2023, they still deducted a payment of {$80.00} from my bank account, which threw all of my other payments off and caused several NSF charges and payments to be denied. They did refund the {$80.00}, but have not transferred my secured savings of {$3000.00} into my account. 
The first time I called in, the representative stated she could see where I paid off the loan and to wait a couple of hours for the closure to show up on the website. I did so, there was a "" click here '' button to request transfer of funds. I went through all the motions and at the end, once I clicked "" I agree '' there was an error message due to account status. I made a few more calls to SST. I was told to wait exactly 15 days.

I went online for a loan and looked at XXXX XXXX  but on a {$1000.00} loan the interest was {$500.00} dollars which is 50 % for a total of {$1500.00}. So I tried a company called Amplify.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I contacted PHH Mortgage today ( XX/XX/XXXX) and advised them that due to COVID-19 I could not make my mortage payment BUT I could pay the principal and interest on time ( by tomorrow which I have done anyway ) and then the escrow amount when my stimulus check arrives, hopefully within the next two weeks. 
They indicated to me that the payment of principal and interest would be placed in a suspense account until the escrow amount was paid and I WOULD be charge a late fee. 
That does not seem ethical. The escrow funds belong to me not to the lender, it is my money that they collect as a convenience to the mortgage holder NOT REQUIRED. The principal and interest is being paid on time and that should not be subject to a late fee, after all they are collecting interest on the money that they are holding and not applying to my account. 
My only option is forbearance which I don't really need, nor do I need the additional interest being accrued during the forebearance period. 
I appreciate that they have a forebearance program for people but that is not what I am asking for, only that they waive late fees.",,3607385

Fraud or scam,"In XXXX we had 2 large ACH withdraws out of our Chase account totaling about {$11000.00}. We were able to go INTO the branch and file a fraud complaint resulting in getting our funds put back into our account. 

I had most of our money in our new savings account which is an account we do not typically have activity in because it just sits holding money. I more closely monitor our checking account because that one has activity in it. I did not notice the {$2.00} ACH from our savings XX/XX/XXXX then in XXXX XXXX {$2.00} and {$2.00} XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX {$3.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$3.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$1.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$9.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$3.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$9.00} At first I glanced at these smaller amounts because so minute I thought dividends it did not register. Then on XX/XX/XXXX as the country was facing a pandemic and things were shutting down larger amounts started coming out. I was like most people dealing with job loss, children having to learn how to work from home to keep up with schooling. My husband was trying to retain the clients he had by offering free services so that they might return when businesses opened up again. Not normal circumstances for anyone. 

As we sat struggling through quarantine, the hackers successfully removed {$7400.00} from my savings in 10 transactions between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified that I reached the withdraw limit that's when I noticed the activity and filed with chase fraud that moment. Because they were so helpful the first time this happened I had no doubt that they would seen this fraudulent activity and we would see out money again. 

I understand that this is spread over a period of time. What they need to understand is the situation itself. This is an account that we let sit so do not check on it as often as we should. The actual time frame with the most money stolen was during a worldwide pandemic which everyones focus was all over. The vendor name on the ACH transfers was one we are familiar seeing because we use XXXX XXXX   however this is not actually XXXX. Even that did not put up a red flag at first glance. 

There is information I found when looking at regulation E which was written back in the XXXX XXXX when we really didn't use online banking like we do now. Perhaps that should be updated. Apparently there is only a 60 day window from the first transaction which there was only one XX/XX/XXXX for {$2.00} then nothing until XX/XX/XXXX so nothing else is even considered even though it is straight up theft any way you look at it. I do take responsibility for being in a terrible situation along with the entire world, country, and state and I do wish I would have caught this in XXXX. If it was in the checking which we use daily it would have been caught ASAP, first attempt.

Incorrect information on credit report,My XXXX XXXX Credit Card was paid off XXXX 2014 in full and the history always paid as agreed and never late. Equifax is showing negative remarks on my credit report.,,1379757
Fees or interest,"I have had a MasterCard ( MC ) with Bank of America ( BoA ) for well over a decade. Until early 2019, I also had checking and savings accounts with them ( for decades ), but I had to close those accounts because BoA decided to start putting holds on my on-time, ATM-deposited check payments for my MC balance, holds long enough to incur a late-payment penalty, for checks from a credit union account which they had been promptly clearing for years. That is not the issue for the current complaint, but is the point in time at which BoA starting playing these MC payment games. 

The current complaint begins XXXX XX/XX/2019, when I used BoA 's phone payment system to make a {$400.00} payment to my MC via "" electronic '' check. This was the first time I had paid via this method, and when I entered my credit union 's routing number and account number, I entered the account number as I always do, that is, without any leading zeroes. The next day I checked to see if the payment had cleared, it had not. Called BoA customer service, was told that they needed the leading zeroes, gave them the full account number for the e-check and was then told that only ONE charge of {$400.00} would be made to my credit union account.

Checked my balances a while later and saw that TWO {$400.00} charges had been made to my credit union account, both posting on XX/XX/XXXX. Called BoA and was told that the erroneous, extra {$400.00} would be refunded to my credit union account in "" 2 to 5 business days ''. The actual refund was at least 10 business days later. 

I always pay ( at minimum ) the new balance total for each billing period ( and usually, all charges beyond the close of the billing period ) and have never incurred ANY interest charges on my BoA MC. Imagine my surprise when I opened my 2XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/2019 billing statement and saw that I was being charged {$18.00} interest on XX/XX/XXXX Called BoA and after again enduring their ridiculously long wait period, was told that the interest was for the {$400.00} that they had CHARGED to my MC ( posted XX/XX/XXXX) to refund THEIR erroneous, extra {$400.00} previous debit from my credit union checking account! I was then told that they could not immediately refund the erroneous interest, but that the refund would appear on my next billing statement and that I should pay the full amount, including their NEW error, to avoid further interest charges! 

So, I open my BoA MC billing statement for XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/2019 and what do I see? Along with a refund of the {$18.00} erroneous interest, which posted on XX/XX/XXXX there is an ADDITIONAL interest charge of {$22.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, even though the very same statement shows that I paid the FULL balance total, INCLUDING their erroneous interest charge of {$18.00}, EIGHT DAYS before the payment was due. 

There are two possibilities : 1 ) BoA is not capable of basic financial calculations, OR, 2 ) BoA is using the American Consumer as an unwilling source of what are effectively short-term, zero-interest loans to BoA. 

I know which possibility I believe.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3255487

So the IRS and the bank they use as a middleman both did their part, but Wells Fargo did not. Ultimately what happened was, I used the number off of a check that Wells Fargo assigned to me and put that as my account number and routing number. A check that was given to me should be associated with my accounts. As it turns out, my refund went into another bankers account.

I talked with them, we came up with a settlement amount, which would be over the {$600.00} reporting amount for a Form XXXX. I said that I would like to avoid that, and after calculating what the increase would be, I called back and discussed the terms, asking and making sure that these payments would avoid the Form XXXX After being told that the payment plan would avoid the form, I entered into a settlement agreement and the payments were made on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to complete the terms. After completing the terms and payments, I assumed this was settled. 
On XXXX XXXX, I received a Form XXXX from Bank of America for a discharged debt of {$670.00}.

After calling a general number, I was transferred to XXXX that I was told set up the settlement. I set up a dispute with them after explaining the entire situation, that I was very clear and was told I would avoid the Form XXXX with my increased payment. I was told it would take a week to process. At the end of the week, I called back, and was told that there was no response yet, but a second dispute would speed the process along. So I filed that one week after the first. I also asked to speak with a supervisor, and XXXX XXXX called me back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX from Bank of America.

Approaching the 30 day mark on my original, that dispute was cancelled, and only my second one, filed a week later remained. 
On XXXX, I received a call from XXXX XXXX from the Supervisor 's Office with my reference case ID number. I called back after, and talked with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX told me my dispute had been closed and the Form XXXX would stand as issued. I explained my situation again, and asked where I would go from there. As with everyone I spoke with, I said I specifically stated my intentions, was told that my payments would avoid the XXXX. I asked how to get a copy of the call, and he said XXXX people set up these settlements to avoid this situation, that I was mistaken. I again asked how to get a copy and he asked what he would hear if he listened to the call. I again stated that my question was, setting up the payment plan for the additional amount would avoid a Form XXXX. He said he could see my original call when setting up, and he would listen to it. He sounded confident that I was wrong, but would listen to the call and if there was a bank error, he would acknowledge it and work to fix it. He said that he would put me on hold and listen.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"I believe I have made XXXX payments and should qualify for Public Service Loan Forgiveness now, but Fedloan has me at XXXX. The disputed payments include the following : one from XX/XX/XXXX where Fedloan says I "" don't have a bill for this payment, '' but still debited the monthly amount from my bank account. The issue was without my asking for it, they put me into "" disaster forbearance '' because I lived close to the California wildfires despite the fact that the fires did not affect me personally. I called and asked to remove the forbearance, which had been placed for two months, and asked them to bill me as I wished to continue to make payments. They removed the forbearance and only debited my account for one month, but did not create a bill. Therefore, they took my money for one month even though I asked them to take it for two months, and then counted zero months. Another disputed payment is from XX/XX/XXXX during a transition from a prior servicer to Fedloan. This payment has been "" pending manual review '' for over two years. I have submitted proof of payment for this bill but it hasn't changed anything thus far. I called Fedloan and they advised me NOT to submit for forgiveness now because it will be denied. They also said there is "" no timeframe '' for when my disputed payments may be reviewed. I asked if I might speak to their ombudsman or at least a manager and was told "" no.

Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"Hello, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Giggle Finance, a company that markets a financial product that is misleading and deceptive. The product in question is marketed as a loan, but in reality, it is not a loan at all. Instead, it is a purchase of future revenue from the borrower 's business earnings. This deceptive marketing practice is both illegal and unethical, and it puts vulnerable borrowers at risk.

Giggle Finance 's website repeatedly markets the product as a loan, even though the contract explicitly rejects the notion that it is a loan. This is a clear case of false advertising, as it misleads potential borrowers into thinking they are getting a loan when they are not. The website also fraudulently promises that borrowers ( who are actually "" sellers '' of their future revenue ) have "" extreme '' flexibility with repayments and can repay their "" loans '' at their own pace. However, the fine print in the contract requires them to pay a required amount weekly, which is far from flexible. 

This deceptive marketing practice puts vulnerable borrowers at risk of financial ruin. Many people who take out loans are already struggling financially, and they may not fully understand the terms and conditions of the loan they are taking out. By misrepresenting the product as a loan, Giggle Finance is taking advantage of these vulnerable borrowers and putting them in a worse financial situation. 

Therefore, I urge the CFPB to investigate Giggle Finance 's marketing practices and take appropriate action against the company. This kind of misleading and deceptive marketing is both illegal and unethical, and it should not be tolerated. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,6953405

Struggling to pay mortgage,"My predatory negative amortization mortgage loan has been a problem since the day I was coerced into signing the loan documents.

We had engaged in a review for modification with Nationstar in the past and the file had moved into the underwriting stage when Nationstar set a foreclosure sale date.

I was not aware that if I paid the minimum payment that the balance would go upI was not aware that the interest rate could begin adjusting the month after the loan was writtenI was not aware that if the loan recast that my mortgage payment would essentially double.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"My Federal loans were transferred to XXXX recently. During the process, my Public Loan Forgiveness payments got lost in the shuffle so i went about rectifying them them. Once I d collected the certifications, I called XXXX because it looked like 2 of 3 loans were ripe for discharge just leaving about 60 payments left on a loan that was never consolidated- the amount of that loan was around $ XXXX. During that call, the representative told me consolidating the $ XXXX loan into the others would be a back door and an extra boost towards PSLF. Please note the consolidation advice was in the call logs when I called back at a later date. 

Excited, I immediately consolidated the third loan into the other two. Somewhere along the line, I read or heard that consolidation would set the counter to zero. I absolutely panicked, called XXXX who confirmed the notes reflected they told me to do consolidate and after some backpedaling the XXXX rep said it would only temporarily set the PSLF payment to zero qualifying payments and then Id be pushed over the qualifying payment minimum ( XXXX ) to forgiveness. Nonetheless, between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I sent frantic emails asking studntaid.gov and to Aidvantahe to cancel the consolidation as I was in mortal fear Id lose a $ XXXX discharge. 

I received one responsive email on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM : XXXX XXXX, Please accept our heartfelt gratitude for all you do to protect our freedoms and know that your time, commitment, and service are truly appreciated. I called on Friday and left a message on your voicemail. We were able to pull this information from StudentAid.gov. We believe this may be what XXXX is suggesting. How does this work if I consolidate loans with different amounts of time in repayment? Assuming your repayment history overlaps for each loan, the consolidation loan will be credited with the longest amount of time in repayment of the loans that were consolidated. For example, say you had 50 months of time in repayment on one Subsidized Stafford Loan and 100 months of time in repayment on another Subsidized Stafford Loan. If you consolidated those loans, you would receive credit for 100 months of payments on the new Direct Consolidation Loan. If your repayment history does not overlap for each loan, the consolidation loan may be credited with more time in repayment than the loan with the longest amount of time in repayment. Using the same example above, if the loan with 50 months of time in repayment included XX/XX/XXXX in repayment status but the loan with 100 months did not, the resulting consolidation loan might be credited with 101 months of payments. This can occur where borrowers relied on different repayment, forbearance, or deferment options on different loans for the same period. We will start processing loans that are eligible for forgiveness later this year. If you have loans with different counts and one of those loans qualifies for forgiveness, you may benefit from consolidating in order to get all of your loans forgiven at the same time. If you do, you would receive forgiveness because the consolidation loan will be credited with the longest amount of time in repayment. Why do I have to apply to consolidate by the end of XXXX? The adjustment will be applied to most borrowers~~ accounts in XXXX. It will be applied only to Direct and FFEL Program loans held by ED. If you have commercially held FFEL or any Perkins or HEAL loans, you will need to consolidate them before the end of XXXX to benefit from the account adjustment.

I called this military benefits section again and was advised that they emailed me at XXXX pm on the day the cancellation of the consolidation was due ( XX/XX/XXXX ) at XXXX. The problem with that is twofold : the email i have a copy of says no such thing AND I submitted a complaint on this platform asking it be cancelled on XXXX. I emailed EVERYONE who would listen. Theres an official case stamp about it in here. This is not the intent of the administration- to saddle a borrower with $ XXXX that was paid off a week ago. When I originally called XXXX and they told me to consolidate CONSOLIDATION WASN'T EVER ON MY RADAR. I am distraught. Obviously, I did not put myself in a situation to pay XXXX more years on almost XXXX. I did so at the instruction of the representative. Further, I continue to get contradictory information from Studentaid.gov, anidvantage and Mohela about what is happening. Ineed this corrected, permanently. 

XXXX, aidvantge and studentaid should not be allowed to process any action that puts a borrower further from discharge than they were originally. Its predatory. Im asking that both my situation be personally remedied and that XXXX be on notice that this behavior will be sanctions.

So with all that being said, why is Discover saying that the account belongs to me when they stipulated in the closed resolution letter dated XX/XX/XXXX enclosed, that they had taken action to remove my name from the account and so forth as stated above.

Taking/threatening an illegal action,"I have had a PayPal account for about 8 years now in good standing. Recently my account was locked and all of my funds are unavailable while it 's locked.

This is in complete violation with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I can not have my funds held and my account locked because of somebody elses debt. This is also defamation of character to insinuate that I actually abused their service somehow and in some way am attempting to avoid a debt or steal money. This PayPal account is what I use to run my business to earn a living to feed my family. It is utterly shocking that a company can do this to myself and many others with NO repercussions what so ever. I searched the internet and it seems that all these practices they are doing like this are in violation of XXXX thing or another, so why is this company continuing it 's underhanded practices without paying every time it 's found that they are in violation?

On XX/XX/XXXX the account was transferred to a different company called SST, Or Systems and services technologies inc. at this time I was advised that no changes will be made to my original contract and that SST would be handling my account further. I was also advised that the savings account that was originally set up by XXXX XXXX XXXX in part with the XXXX account, would be safe and secure and released to me 14 days after the final pay off was made.

I discovered through various reviews of other customers that this is an ongoing issue with this company and no one is getting their money from their borrow and grow accounts as originally planned.

However, Im not disputing the loan, I disputing their right and ability to take funds from my account when I specifically requested in writing that they stop all ACH abs debits from my checking account. According to consumer finance : You have the right to stop a payday lender from taking automatic electronic payments from your account, even if you previously allowed them. You may have signed a payment authorization, which is sometimes called an ACH Authorization. This gives the payday lender the ability to debit your account when your payment is due. According to Consumer Finance I am well within my rights to request that they revoke payments and I took proper procedures to make the  request. I have a copy of the written request and a picture of my call log making the initial verbal request as proof.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"Hello- I'm writing to express my sincere concern that the U.S. Department of Education contract with Nelnet , student loan servicing company. This company is bewideringly opaque around application of payments to interest vs principle across different subloans ( which one can not access except by special request -- and usually very long phone calls ). Astoundingly, the company do not post the current loan balances ( principles ) on their website, unlike other loan or mortgage company -- making trying to determine remaining principle time consuming and challenging. Similarly, trying to understand end dates for repayment is nigh impossible. 

I just spent XXXX hours on the phone trying to understand why none of my {$1300.00} per month payment was applied to principle for 15 months, whereas previously over the prior several years about half was applied to interest and half to principle. The first call started with being put on hold for XXXX minutes and ended with me being hung up on after I ( very politely ) tried to understand the confusing explanation ( I don't think she actually knew ). The second call lasted XXXX minutes with about half the time on hold before I was transferred to a manager who appeared to have a better understanding but was still not able to actually answer my question, rather repeating that it was due to the company 's automated algorithm that was designed to benefit the consumer. Unlikely. 

For a company of Netnet 's size, the only plausible explanation for their lack of transparency is financial incentive. Which, I don't need to point out, comes at the expense of the consumer. Luckily, I'm reasonably financially stable and can somewhat navigate the complexities of the Netnet ecosystem, so not extremely important personally. But, frankly, I'm appalled when I consider the large number of consumers that have more limited finances or have difficulty understanding the Netnet system. A quick scan of internet reaffirms the highly irregular nature of this company although, again, concerningly, the other government contracted student loan servicing companies have similarly poor reputations. 

Given student loans are an integral part of the education system in this country, the fact that our federal government contract and indirectly condone such egregious companies is breathtaking. A meaningful investigation into these practices is past due.",,5083090

Fees or interest,"Chase back has raised the interest rate for my account from 22 % APR to an astonishing 25 % APR. In my current situation, the 22 % APR was barely manageable. Chase failed to disclose this interest by means of notification. I log into my account to budget payments and saw the change. I called chase and they offered to send me a letter stating the increase. I stated the letter should have been sent before the increase, a letter now is useless since they made the change. I spoke with a supervisor and request a lower interest rate since the 25 % is ludicrous. He said that the rate was tied to the fed increase in interest rate. I find this to be faulty logic since my account is with Chase not with the Fed. I understand that the Fed increase will hurt their business but that does not mean that can raise my interest rate with out any notification. 

My next steps is to transfer the balance to a low interest rate credit card that will be manageable. I would for Chase to admit their mistake, stop this practice, and offer a monetary compensation for my frustration. For nearly 8 years I was their customer and made all payments on times. I accepted the interest fee on my accounts as part of the agreement I made. It is unacceptable for them to raise my fees with out so much of the courtesy to notify me, yet they always send emails for me to transfer balance at 0 % or to use the card at certain stores.",,6198985

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"On XXXX. XXXX, 2023 I received an email from Explore Credit saying I was approved for {$1000.00}. I ignored it as spam as I get those a lot and know to never click links. Then I started getting voice mails and text messages ; also not uncommon. When they didn't stop I copied the URL to the website and using their log-in instructions, found a loan document in my name, complete with old bank account information -- the bank account is still active but I barely use it and haven't in years because the nearest branch is over XXXX hours away from me. I never applied for a loan with this company. I scrolled through the application and saw it was a payday company. I never signed. Then I started getting messages to verify my bank account so they could see my balances by linking them to it electronically. I NEVER do that except with reputable companies, government agencies or other banks. I closed the website and ignored it all. 

The next day ( XXXX. XXXX ) I got another email saying to check my bank account. I ignored it. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I got a overdraw notice from my bank. I checked my account and they had tried to withdraw a payment for {$300.00} and change. I didn't have that in my account so my bank refused but charged me {$24.00}. I immediately emailed customer service ( at the email I provided in this complaint ) and was told that I applied for a loan. I said I did not. The next response they admitted I hadn't : "" you're right you didn't apply with us but we got your information. '' How is that okay? They just somehow hacked my personal information, put it in a loan application and somehow got access to my bank account? 

Then, they said that I did "" e-sign '' the application and sent me a copy, with my electronic "" signature '' on XXXX. XXXX. I did not sign anything, I just scrolled through portions of the document, not even the entire thing. 

Since they, I have repeatedly asked them to quit attempting withdrawals, told them they had no authorization or consent. They kept repeating that an email with that request in writing wasn't "" acceptable '' as part of their process. That is not my understanding of the law. I have very poor cell phone service out where I live and I was not going to call someone I never initiated contact with in the first place and that was likely scamming me. I also reminded them that I never did any electronic or online bank verification process. Then they later told me ( again, via email ) they'd only stop withdrawal attempts if I sent them 3 months of bank statements. I told them I wasn't going to send bank statements to a random individual from an organization I'd never heard of before. 

So far they have tried to withdraw payments 8 times, resulting in over {$200.00} in overdraft fees TO ME. I've put in a fraud complaint to my bank but they said they may not be able to do anything since they had my bank account info, that it was easier for them to do if it was through the debit card -- which doesn't make sense to me. 

Right now I don't know what to do except close this bank account, which I've had for over 10 years and don't want to do, especially since I'll have to make up the over {$200.00} in overdraft fees Explore Credit has caused. 

I am attaching the "" loan agreement '' they sent me that they said I signed- all it has is a typed name on the bottom ; I never signed anything, and it even says at the top of the document that underwriting needs to verify and approve everything - I did not connect my bank to them for verification which in a separate email to me they said was required.

Lost or stolen money order,"First off, the money is not lost or stolen. It was damaged and I possess what is left - about 75 % - enough to read the amount, who it should have been paid to, my address, most of my signature, the routing and numbers on the bottom, and where I purchased it from. 

The money order I purchased to pay my rent was returned to me by the US Postal Service with an apology for damaging my mail. I took my purchase receipt, the money order receipt ( bottom portion ) plus what was left of the money order and the USPS enveloped back to the place where I purchased it but they were unable to replace it. I called the Western Union customer service number and spoke to XXXX who proceeded to inform me that I needed to fill out the back of the money order receipt, include {$15.00} payable to them in a personal check and then wait 60 days. Why? I do n't want a refund. I want them to take the damaged money order I paid cash for and replace it. I do n't want a stop payment. I do n't have 60 days to wait and my landlord wo n't wait. Today, I have accrued {$80.00} in late fees. To say I 'm on a budget would be an understatement on a grand scale. 

XXXX put me on hold while he went and found his supervisor. Then when he 'found ' his supervisor and transferred the call, well I waited on hold for 30 minutes before hanging up. 

Bottom line here, Western Union was paid for a service with cash. They are now collecting interest by withholding my funds and want another {$15.00}. Not acceptable by any means.",,2217669

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I previously submitted a claim regarding Navient for harassment, unwillingness to work with me on a payment amount for my loans ( they wanted more than my rent monthly which I could not even remotely afford ), refusal to provide a payment plan in writing, refusal to keep to a payment plan discussed over the phone, and general belligerent and unethical business practices. I worked with XXXX XXXX to resolve this, which took months but it appeared to have been resolved with my only paying XXXX interest monthly.

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"I regret to have to do this, but it pains me to notify you of some rude behavior of a supervisor over the phone. I have had payday loans for a long time with no issues overall from Moneytree. I only had one other time they had to reverse a fee because I was given incorrect information from another Moneytree representative over the phone. I have gotten increases in my available loan amounts, which shows I have excellent history.

And yet, because ONE check was sent to my bank and got returned, which caused me a {$25.00} NSF fee from my bank, the manager only came off that it was all my fault and that she refused to call my bank on a three way call as a COMMON COURTESY to explain that this was an unforeseen error. I never received the text message I normally get as a reminder of any due date, and had I gotten that message, I would have called right away to change my due date to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I never get upset, but this manager got me very upset. She was rude and refused to serve the customer in a common capacity by representing that customer to the bank explaining what happened. This is because the banks often want to hear from the company the reason for the returned check. And the only reason why they sent the ACH is because they did not receive a payment or call by the due date of XX/XX/XXXX, which is a new due date for me to begin with. Normally my due date is around the XXXX of each month. 

People are people. They make mistakes. They forget. They get busy. But as you will see from my excellent history with XXXX, there was NO reason why this had to happen to me. And it is a fact she admitted there was no policy or law preventing her from doing a three-way call to my bank. So, in essence, she REFUSED SERVICE in a common and respectful manner, causing me to get very frustrated with her. I think we are all adults I explained, and there is no reason for me to be treated in this manner. 

I am thinking seriously about never using their services again after I pay off this loan, unless this is resolved, and she is talked to about this behavior. I felt more than insulted and disrespected by her, and I said Im the customer, and I have been doing payday loans and other services with your company for a very long time. There is no reason for this counter-productive and negative treatment to me. I can not repeat that enough. 

People in corporations and business should never be allowed to get away with this. The customer is always right, especially when things like this happen to us. This took place today, XX/XX/2020, about XXXX XXXX   mountain time. I had called into the phone number XXXX, but my situation required the representative who answered the phone to transfer me to the payment center, and then from there the representative had me to talk to her manager. You have to get the names from your research.

I expect something in support for me to be done about this. She can wave all the fees she wants. That does not excuse her behavior, and also the refusal to honor my request to explain to my bank what happened, so the bank has a reason from an actual company over the phone. I have already sent the request to my credit union to reverse the NSF fee, in addition to this situation. 

I am a genuine and kind person, but any normal person would feel this way if they are treated in the manner I was. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Thank you.

Closing your account,"Hello, I am submitting a complaint against an unfair practice that CapitalOne Credit card is using to close customer 's accounts without any warning due to a returned payment or two. After being a customer of CapitalOne for over 3 years and opening a Secured Credit card, and never having a late payment and generally keeping under my limit for the entire time the account was open, my account was abruptly closed without warning due to 2 returned payments that were made well before the due date and I still had time to rectify and have my bank send a payment before the actual due date. They did not contact me via email or phone to ask the reason the payments may have been returned, and allow me time to fix the issue. All they did was send an email that the account was closed on the same day that a payment was successfully received from my bank. I believe that if a consumer has an account in good standing, with no late payments should be contacted bu a phone call, email or letter warning that if this is to happen again the account could be closed and offer the customer a chance to call XXXX  and explain and fix the issue before closing out an account that is in good standing.",,4877078

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I fell behind on my mortgage after losing my job. I was forced to file bankruptcy, however I wanted to save my home. Loancare has evaded and blocked me from applying for assistance now since the beginning of 2016. I hired an attorney to help me deal with Loancare and they have been calling Loancare now for over two years. Loancare has told my attorney my loan had bankruptcy codes on it and they could not review me. This is even though my bankruptcy has been discharged almost two years ago. They then told my attorney the reason the bankruptcy codes are not removed was because they needed for my bankruptcy case to actually close. My bankruptcy attorney says there is no reason Loancare can not review and modify my loan. Loancare advised until the bankruptcy case was closed, which takes about a year they couldn't do anything. Finally my bankruptcy case was closed and my attorney applied for assistance. Loancare sent my attorney the attached letter denying the modification application with no reason. They claim the owner of this loan does not allow them to modify the loan. My attorney has a very experienced underwriter who actually deals with loan pool servicing issues often and he says this can not be true. Loancare should contact the investor and ask for permission. The constraints Loancare is talking about are old and those barriers are no longer in place. In addition, guidelines call for the servicer to make an attempt to contact the servicer to ask permission and Loancare has not attempted this.

Incorrect information on your report,"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the ""  would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect XXXX XXXX format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, XXXX XXXX statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 

Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified XXXX XXXX compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 

1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory XXXX XXXX Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported  delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 

3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes  invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL.

6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in  absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory XXXX XXXX format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3221537

When I logged onto the Citi website to review the XX/XX/XXXX statement I discovered I had been charged {$100.00} in late fees and interest in addition to {$55.00} for the renewal of my XXXX membership on XX/XX/XXXX Despite enrolling in paperless statements when I received the card I had received no previous notices that my statement was avaiable, so I had assumed there had been no charges on the card. 

I attempted to get the late fees removed by discussing it with multiple Citi representitives on the phone and by on-line chat, but all they were willing to do was refund XXXX of the late charges, and only after I paid the current balance. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$120.00} and a late charge of {$37.00} was removed from the account. 

I want the remaining late fees and interest of {$65.00} to be credited back to the account. Citi failed to notify me of the outstanding balance until XXXX months and XXXX statement closings after the first statement went unpaid.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","Timeline and Documentation XX/XX/XXXX-I Contacted Wells Fargo Home Mortgage ( WF ) to find out my options to remove PMI and to add a co-borrower. 
XXXX XXXX was our WF Mortgage Consultant. He told us that we did not quite meet the requirement of XXXX % LTV to entirely remove PMI through a refinance. 
We stated that it did n't make financial sense to incur thousands of dollars in costs to refinance unless we were able to remove the PMI. 
XXXX XXXX estimated that we would reach XXXX % LTV XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX. 
We told XXXX XXXX that we would revisit the option to refinance XX/XX/XXXX to ensure that PMI was removed as that was the main goal of the refinance. 
He stated that the lender was required to automatically remove the PMI when the loan reached XXXX % LTV under the Home Owner 's Protection Act ( HPA ). 
Additionally, he stated that under the HPA the borrower could request that the lender remove PMI when the LTV reach XXXX %. 
XXXX XXXX said that if we proceeded with the refinance in XX/XX/XXXX, that we could place a call to the lender when the loan reached XXXX % LTV to request WF remove the PMI. 
I asked about additional fees and costs associated with the request to remove PMI and he stated that there should n't be any because the Lender can use the appraisal from the XX/XX/XXXX refinance. 
XXXX XXXX counseled us on mortgage interest rates and how they were going up. He said we should take advantage while the rates were historically low. 
He recommended that we proceed with the appraisal and if the appraisal did n't come in high enough to allow for the refinance to go through that we would get a refund. 
XXXX XXXX also stated that if we had any trouble when the time came to remove the PMI to contact him for help. 
We proceeded as XXXX XXXX recommended XX/XX/XXXX-The appraised value came in at {$400000.00} ( XXXX % LTV ) We questioned the need for PMI and were assured by XXXX XXXX that we could call and have it removed when we hit XXXX % LTV on XX/XX/XXXX. 
We reviewed our documents including the amortization schedules carefully. 
XX/XX/XXXX-The refinance closed XX/XX/XXXX-The loan was transferred to XXXX Exhibit XXXX I reviewed my escrow account monthly to ensure we were on track to meet the 80 % XXXX requirement by XXXX. 
XXXX-I contacted WF customer service to request that they remove the PMI. 
I was told that we were not eligible until the loan reached XXXX % LTV. I pushed back citing the Lender 's required to remove PMI at XXXX % LTV but that the borrower can request it be removed at XXXX % LTV pursuant to the HPA. 
I was then told that I would need to obtain another appraisal for {$550.00} or pay {$8000.00} to reduce LTV to XXXX %. 
We do meet all other requirements. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from WF XX/XX/XXXX-I contacted XXXX XXXX, our WF Mortgage Consultant requesting his help.

I then found my receipts for them and contacted Western Union and they informed me that they were never cashed. They told me what i needed to do to get a refund check sent to me so i can pay my rent. I filled them out and sent them in to Western Union. After not hearing anything back from them i called in mid XXXX and they informed me they sent a refund check out but it did not go to me or my address. After speaking to numerous supervisors and customer service reps i have gotten no where they informed me to email my documents again and they would escalate the issue but still almost 2 months later and i still do have a refund check for the XXXX dollar money orders i purchased. Which means somewhere there has been fraud committed because someone had to have altered the refund information to be able to issue a check out that was my money to someone else. I am needing help to recover my money.,,3744831

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"I am trying to improve my credit score and opened a {$300.00} credit card account with Capital One.I chose them because they were advertised on XXXX XXXX and they give the cash back option for all purchases. I started using it for everyday cash purchases and using the online function to pay the bill after it would reach a point as long as I had the amount in my checking account. I stayed in touch with Capital One 's call center and had suspicion it was n't in the USA but did n't want to be labeled a XXXX. I travelled out of town to California to visit my little brother who has XXXX. While doing so I made a payment and unbeknownst to me, a family member at home who has access to my personal bank account in case I should die, removed money for their valid use without my knowledge causing my payment to be rejected. When I returned home and found out and before Capital One knew about it, I called to notify them and let them know what I was doing to remedy my balance with Capital One. Shortly there after within a few days, I received a call from some foreign sounding man, telling me my bank had refused to give him my personal banking numbers, including routing, Social Security number, address, etc. etc. He demanded I give it to him, I refused, He got irate and wanted me to email him the info, i refused, he wanted me to XXXX call my bank, I refused and politely asked him to put it in writing on official capital one letterhead. He was n't happy and started threatening that he was going to suspend or restrict my card, to which I said something to the effect of give it your best shot and hung up. My account was restricted and I made numerous ( XXXX ) calls to follow-up and resolve it. I did receive a letter telling me they suspected fraud 10 days later and that I needed to call to resolve the matter. Nothing in writing said I had to provide my personal info in writing to Capital One. I did manage to get on-line and delete my bank info for online paying of my bill. The next day I was restricted from signing into my account. The following day I could sign in. I spoke to someone in the escalation department, again, they wanted that personal info. I said no, that 's not their concern and I was using it according to the rules. i then asked, If they did not release the restrictions to close the account. They atre refusing to close my account until I Provide Them the information. I have paid it down to XXXX and they still will not close my credit card account. I have asked numerous times for the name and address of an executive in the USA that I can write to that will have the authority to close my account and they refuse to give me that.

"Managing, opening, or closing account","I received a pre-paid VISA from XXXX which was issued by CITI Group in the amount of {$150.00} in XXXX. It had an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. A copy of the card is attached. I misplaced the card and I did not use the card by that date. I found the card in XX/XX/XXXX. I asked XXXX to issue me another one - they told me I had to talk to CITI. I called CITI XX/XX/XXXX and they told me that the card was no longer valid and that they could not issue me another one, nor could they give me any money - they said that the card showed a zero balance due to it having not been used by the prescribed use-by date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Now fast forward - I read somewhere that what CITI told me was not correct. I called CITI again on XX/XX/XXXX and this time they told me that the card did in fact have a balance of {$120.00} - I asked them why it only had a balance of {$120.00} and they told me that it was being surcharged {$3.00} per month for being dormant. I asked them to give me the {$120.00} - in some form or fashion - either a check, reactivate the card or issue a new card. CITI told me that they could not return the money to me - that is a pretty good trick - The money is there and they get to keep it until they surcharge it down to nothing even though I have asked for the money or another card.

Problem when making payments,"On multiple occasions, I attempted to render full payment on my TD Bank credit card issued in conjunction with a purchase at XXXX XXXX XXXX. TD Bank rejected payment on the purported basis that my check lacked an account number, which was a patent falsity. 

I again wrote a check for the full debt amount on or about XX/XX/2019. Before that check was cashed, I received a debt collection call from TD Bank, during which the employee recognized that I had made previous payment attempts. I was told that my paper check had again been rejected due to a purported lack of an account number. I again attempted to make complete payment, this time over the phone. 

In conjunction with my phone payment, on XX/XX/2019, {$6400.00} was deducted from my checking account, reflecting a payment of my debt in full. Then, the next day, TD Bank attempted with withdraw a SECOND COMPLETE PAYMENT of {$6400.00} from my account, based upon my physical check that TD Banks own employee claimed had been rejected. This causes by checking account to overdraft, resulting in bank fees. In addition, despite my full payment, TD Bank is now demanding that I pay a {$35.00} check return fee, despite my full payment and being told that my check had already been rejected. 

TD Banks behavior has been opaque and misleading. I feel as if my attempts to pay my debt in full have been arbitrarily rejected to either extend the interest-chargeable life of my debt or to cause me to incur fees.",,3352638

No other details were given that could help me understand their decision. 
Finally a letter dated XXXX XXXX stated I was approved to participate in a short sale.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"In XXXX 2016 I read a news article about Capital One offering their new "" Credit Wise '' free credit monitoring app for download. They claimed one did not need an acct, which I do not have, in order to sign up. I downloaded the app on my XXXX and then opened the app and started the free sign up process. I filled out the app 's forms and at a certain point the app noticed that I already had a Capital One acct and asked me for my login and email and password. I attempted to login several times and received error code XXXX. I eventually gave up and contacted Capital One fraud dept. by telephone to notify them that I do not have a credit card acct. Their customer service team attempted to assist and could not understand why this was happening so they escalated/passed the complaint to their internal "" security/IT '' team. They called back and gave me further instructions to attempt login to the "" Credit Wise '' app and those failed as well. They sounded confused over the phone. Ironically, several months after this occurred I started to receive text message alerts that someone was attempting to use my Capital One XXXX card for purchases and they asked me if the purchases were valid via text. I responded "" no '' and did not hear back from them. For the record, I do not have a Capital One XXXX Card nor have been able to login to their "" Credit Wise '' app. I believe they have not done enough to ensure that someone illegally has a credit card in my name or have produced a valid reason why this is happening to me. After reading news about other large banks creating fake credit card and bank accounts recently, I decided to proceed to an FTC complaint since Capital One XXXX and their Credit Wise app security team has failed to assist.",,2118760

We received a letter approximately XX/XX/XXXX stating the account would be closed, they could not give a reason, the letter stated this decision was not reversible and there was no appeal or explanation, we have excellent credit and they stated it was not related to fraud and we have not had any issue with any fraud recently so i dont have any idea why they will not allow us to have an account. The BOA company did not close my credit card account? My wife went to the local branch to see if she could get any more info and they were not able to offer any, they stated the account would be officially closed XX/XX/XXXX and we would be receiving a check for the balance of the account in 7-10 days, after receiving the letter i inquired about withdrawing all of our funds while they closed the account however they officially do that and they said i can not withdraw any of that money and have to wait for the check. We NEVER had access to the {$9000.00} that was deposited on XX/XX/XXXX. ( As I write this it is XX/XX/XXXX ), we still have not received the check, my wife had set up the electric, cable, etc to come out of this account and had to scramble to get these back to our XXXX account so we did not have late fees or bills not paid. To date both of us steadily receive email offers to open accounts with them, which is baffling.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","This is a follow up complaint regarding DovenMuehle Mortgage. The original issue has not been resolved. 
My issue with Dovenmuehle Mortgage Company ( DMC ) began in XX/XX/XXXX ; they still have {$10000.00} as of today, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Short background : I am the trustee for my best friend 's estate. When she died I sent documents to DMC asking to transfer the mortgage into the trust. I received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX stating "" We are pleased to inform you that the issue in your correspondence has been addressed ''. 
As trustee I had to manage the financial and logistical issues surrounding damage to the home she owned. That home holds a mortgage with DMC. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received XXXX checks totaling {$15000.00} from the homeowners insurance for repairs to the mortgaged property from a flood. Since the checks listed DMC and my name ( as trustee of the Trust ) as co-payees, I submitted that check to DMC with a letter asking them cosign and return to me. Heard nothing for over a month. I called and they said that the checks would be forthcoming. Two weeks later on XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me the same checks that I had sent them, asking for me to cosign and return them to them ; which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they cashed the checks and put the money in escrow and released {$5200.00}, in a check made payable to the estate. Since there was no estate, just the Trust - of which I am the trustee, I had difficulty depositing that check. The bank relented but said that they would not make that exception again. That check came with a lien waiver but no explanation. I called and asked them why they kept the money ( and made the check payable to the wrong payee ). They said that they needed the contactor to sign a lien waver to release the funds. Since the work was not done and the contractor not paid, I had to find funds from other sources to complete the work, pay the contractor so that he would sign the lien waver. 

I submitted that lien waver to DMC on XX/XX/XXXX with a letter indicating that the work was complete and DMC should issue the remaining funds. Due to the lack of communication, the length of time, the terrible customer service and the withholding of funds due to me, I filed the above listed complaint ( Case number : XXXX ) with the CFPB. DMC responded to that complaint with a lengthy letter enumerating what they had done to resolve this situation. More than 90 % of the items they listed, they had not performed and the 2 checks for the remaining funds were issued. 

Two checks arrive on XX/XX/XXXX. One in the amount of {$10000.00} and one for {$35.00} presumably for interest, though there was no accompanying documentation. Problem solved? 

No ... the checks were both made payable to the Estate. The bank, not surprisingly would n't cash the checks, saying that I could only do so if I opened a separate account, in the name of the estate - but I could only do that if the estate was probated, which is one of the reasons trusts are in place. 

There is no estate ; there never was. There is a trust. I hired an estate lawyer ; I was advised that an Affidavit of Small Estate should be sent to DMC. I complied and sent that with other documentation and the unredeemed checks back to be reissued on XX/XX/XXXX. Weeks go by and once again the XXXX hole that is DMC did not respond On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX ( XXXX ) in DMC-Loss Draft and left a message. Three days later she returned my call and said that there was nothing DMC could do. Her supervisor ( XXXX ) said the same thing. According to them, I had reached the end of XXXX road - no resolution. I asked what I could to do resolve this problem and they simply repeated that they could n't help me.

Can't repay my loan,"I was forced to take out private loans in order to continue or finish my degree. XXXX XXXX had already maxed out, so to speak, the amount of money I could borrow from federal loans and the rest had to be loaned from private banks. Nearing graduation, about a week before graduation, I received a letter from XXXX stating that I owed an extra {$14000.00} that was credited to me by the school, and that I had to pay said balance to be able to graduate and receive my diploma. I used my life savings and wrote them a check for {$14000.00} and gave it to the finance department. In the end, I had all my transcripts for graduation but my diploma was not provided. I walked my graduation with the worthless transcripts in my diploma folder. I never went back to pick up my diploma as it was worth absolutely nothing. My resume lists a XXXX XXXX from XXXX but no employer or future employer has ever recognized me as having a real XXXX XXXX. At this point it hurts my reputation to put XXXX on my resume as education. 

The debt has crippled me financially and ruined my credit while lowering the possibilities of gaining approval from potential employers. I feel like I 've missed out on a decade of my life. In retrospect, I would have rather attended a XXXX college and transferred to a regionally accredited XXXX College instead. XXXX predatory behavior and even harassing phone calls asking to come back to school were hard to ignore and I and many others were stuck in a program that would eventually lead to crippling debt and no value whatsoever. I was already working in the field of study before starting XXXX and I did not learn anything new during my entire program. In fact, the material and books in some cases was about 10-20 years old.

The computer labs and equipment were outdated and in most cases did not work at all. Anyone who attended classes was given a passing grade. XXXX admitted anyone regardless of mental capacity. There were people in my classes who could barely read out loud from a book. 

To conclude, XXXX XXXX was an elaborate scam. They scammed the government and taxpayers as well as individuals hoping to better their futures and contribute to the economy and workforce.

I was called the next day saying my loan was n't approved and they had a new contract. the interest rate was higher as was my monthly payment. I was also told I had to come up with a {$1000.00} downpayment that I had n't needed to before. From the start everything was wrong, my first payment was n't supposed to be due until XX/XX/XXXX and by XX/XX/XXXX I was fighting with them as to not applying my payments correctly. I receive multiple calls throughout the day and you can never reach the same person twice. They wo n't respond via email for documentation either. Well, finally in the Spring of this year, I was told I was assigned an account manager, XXXX. I explained everything that has gone on, with the payment due date and being told that I could move a payment to end of the loan.

Managing an account,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was having dinner at my familys house when at XXXX XXXX I received an email alert from Chase that my email address had been updated. Since I had not authorized this change I logged into my account and noticed two ATM withdrawals that I did not authorize, I drove home and at XXXX XXXX I called Chase customer service to dispute the charges and opened up a claim.
<P/>
I was instructed to go to a bank branch the next morning and close my accounts. I was informed by Chase customer service that the ATM withdrawal was made by requesting a mobile pin #. Before this day I was not aware that this feature was available on my account and if I had known I would have never allowed it, to the point that I would have cancelled my accounts with Chase. I consider this feature a HUGE security flaw and a convenient option for criminals.
<P/>
The following day on XX/XX/XXXX I went to my local branch to close my accounts while there I was told by the representative helping me that I was the 6th person in less than 2 weeks that had this same problem she even knew before I had given her my account information that these withdrawals were done using that horrible mobile pin service that Chase offers. After opening new accounts I was told that I needed to go home and run antivirus scans on my computers, mobile devices and then call the Chase fraud department to create a new online account. After doing what I was instructed to do I called the Chase fraud department to setup my new online profile and was told to contract the credit bureaus to place a fraud alert on my credit. I did this as instructed.
<P/>
From Chase, I never received a claim number for the dispute on the two ATM withdrawals on XX/XX/XXXX17 for {$200.00} and {$300.00}. I never received any correspondence alerting me that the temporary credits had been put on my account nor any correspondence stating that the credits had been reversed and the reasons why. When I called customer service to dispute the reversal I was told that the investigation showed these were valid transactions. I requested from Chase detail of their so called investigation but they have not given me any detail and I consider that there was never an investigation conducted. The simple act of pulling the tapes at whatever ATM was used would show that it was not me. Again these withdrawals were done by obtaining a mobile pin # throughout the entire history of my accounts I have NEVER used this service. I would n't even know how to use this service.
<P/>
The facts of this case are as follow : - Because I did not request a change of email address I checked my account and found two fraudulent ATM withdrawals had been made using this TERRIBLE mobile pin feature.
- As soon as I was able to I called to dispute these charges well within 24 hours.
- If you Chase bothered to look at the history of my account, they would see I have NEVER used this mobile pin # feature.
- If the tape on the ATM was pulled and compared to my picture Chase would have seen that I did not make these withdrawals.
- The bank representative who opened up my new accounts told me herself that this same fraud has happened to several customers that she has dealt with.
<P/>
Chase has never provided me with the findings of your so called investigation. Chase has done a terrible job of keeping me up to date of the progress of my case ( not providing me with a case number, not informing me of credits given, not informing me of credits reversed ). I did everything Chase has asked and they are acting in bad faith and not standing by a long time customer.

"Managing, opening, or closing account","I have a problem with American Express Prepaid cards. American Express owes me a refund of {$8000.00} and, while customer service has told me I 'd get a refund, so far I have n't seen one and it 's been over 3 weeks. 

I placed an order for the gift cards on XX/XX/2016 and paid for delivery within XXXX to 4 days. American Express called me on XX/XX/2016 to verify my address and left a message. They said they could n't process the order without the verification and asked me to call back. I called them back 7 minutes later. What they had failed to tell me is that they were closed and I could n't reach them until XXXX. I called American Express XXXX morning XX/XX/2016. I told them I needed the cards immediately and since I paid to have them delivered in that time frame they would have to process them with overnight delivery so I would receive them on XX/XX/2016. They gave me a number and told me to call them and they could handle it. I called this number and they said could not do that and I would get the gift cards on XXXX, at the earliest. They told me the cards were n't even printed and there was no possibility of getting them earlier. 

Since this was far too late for the holiday cards that these cards were meant for, I told them I 'd need to cancel the order. They told me I had to call back after 24 hours to cancel the cards because they could n't cancel it until the order went through. I called back at XXXX on XXXX and was told they could cancel the order and gave me a case ID of XXXX and that I would receive a refund within 15 days. I asked for a written confirmation and they said they could n't do that. And that I could call back if I had a problem. 

On XXXX, I had to purchase gift cards elsewhere so I could meet work obligations. Late on XXXX, the gift cards arrived, even though, according to American Express the order had not even been processed yet. I called on XXXX to tell them that the cards had arrived, I could not use them because of what American Express ' customer service had told me and to confirm the cancellation. They confirmed it, told me to keep the cards and said it could take up to 20 days for a refund. 

Throughout this process, the customer service was poor and I was never allowed to speak to anyone in the United States. They gave me no other options and said there was nothing they could do to help me. 

It has now been over 20 days and I called, waited for 25 minutes to talk to someone. "" XXXX '', ID # XXXX, told me for some reason it did n't get processed and he would process it again and it would take 15 days. I asked to speak to someone to expedite it and he said I could wait for his supervisor but it would not change the outcome, that I had to wait another 15 days. 

American Express put a hold on my credit card on XX/XX/2016 so they have effectively had my money for 30 days and, according to them it will take another 15 days to get a refund. American Express ' track record is n't good in telling the truth so it 's debatable whether or not I 'll receive a refund this time. 

I would like American Express to refund the full amount immediately as originally promised on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2016",,2286538

My payroll check is deposited on this account and my children have been at home alone for this amount of time because I did not have the money to get home to them, I also have been sleeping in my car because of this hold that nobody seems to be able to explain. I work hard for my money and it is too late for my payroll check to be deposited to a different account. I have now had to miss my children and their activities as well as being forced to sleep in my car due to this conflict of information and lack of an explanation for the hold on my account.

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"FACTS IN BRIEF : I took out a U.S. bank auto loan, dated XX/XX/XXXX, in the original loan amount of approximately {$11000.00} to purchase a used car ( attachment 1 ). The seller also had a U.S. Bank auto loan that was paid off with my new loan. Erroneously, the bank issued the title to the car to the seller, free and clear of all liens, instead of to me with the bank as the lienholder, therefore wiping out both their interest in the car and mine ( attachment 2 ). When I made the bank aware of their error, they did nothing to correct it. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me an email, asking me to bring them the title to the car so they could perfect their lien and protect their asset, even though they knew that they had issued the title to the seller ( attachment 3 ). The seller died within days of my discovering that the bank had erroneously issued her the title free and clear of all liens. I never took possession of the car because I could not get title to it and register it in my name and get insurance on it to protect my asset. 
FACTS IN DETAIL : I received the auto loan agreement in the mail in an envelope dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attachment 4 ). I did not know that the loan had closed until then, even though the loan is dated XX/XX/XXXX, an unreasonable twoXXXX month lapse. The seller had someone drive the car from California to my home in Arizona so I could register it here ; but when we went into the motor vehicle department, we were told that we did not have the necessary paperwork to register it. All that I had received in the envelope dated XXXX XXXX was a copy of the auto loan agreement in attachment 1.  We went into the bank and were told that the title would be coming in the mail to me in the next few weeks. Since I did not have title and could not register the car in my name or get insurance on it to protect my asset, as I said, I did not take possession of the vehicle. In XXXX, three months after the close of the loan, the free and clear title to the vehicle showed up in the sellers name and mailbox. I notified the bank of their error, and as I said they did nothing to correct it. The car was severely damaged while parked in the sellers driveway when a tree fell on it, caused by heavy winds during a major California fire that lasted from XXXX to XXXX. The seller died XX/XX/XXXX. As a lienholder on a loan banks always protect their security interest by requiring insurance on vehicles before they pass title to them ; but the bank did not do this because they made an error and passed title to the seller, free of all liens. 
The loan payments are current and are being automatically deducted from my U.S Bank account monthly in the amount of {$200.00}. I signed up for auto draft to get a reduced payment. I have several accounts at U.S Bank and if I close the account to try to stop them from deducting my payment, they can deduct it out of another account. My husband and I are XXXX XXXX XXXX, and therefore rely on our good credit rating. We have XXXX XXXX XXXX and their attorney at XXXX XXXX sent three demand letters to the bank asking them to rescind the note, refund my payments, and report to the credit agencies that the loan was paid as agreed and in full since they erroneously gave away both the banks interest in the vehicle and mine to a third party ( attachment 5 ). 

In response to the attorneys demand, the bank issued a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX,  stating that the transference of the title to the vehicle was the seller and buyers legal responsibility ( attachment 6 ). This would be the case if it were an unsecured loan. The loan agreement in attachment 1 clearly states that the vehicle, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the SECURITY INTEREST FOR THE LOAN. This means that the bank should have been listed as the lienholder on the title. The bank was holding the title and erroneously issued it to the seller, free and clear of all liens. It was not the legal responsibility of the seller and buyer to establish the bank as the lienholder on the loan, secured by the car. It does not even make good business sense for a bank to shift the legal responsibility of transference of the title to the seller and buyer and entrust them to put the bank on title as the lienholder after they have paid out the funds on the loan. Furthermore, the bank is legally responsible to issue me free and clear title once I pay off the loan, secured by the vehicle, which they will not be able to do. 
After I received this letter from the bank, XXXX sent me to an outside attorney since they will only represent me as a defendant in a case. The outside attorney sent two letters and made several phone calls, requesting someone at the bank contact him ( attachment 7 ). No one at the bank has contacted him and he is now asking for {$10000.00} to enter into a lawsuit on a loan with an original loan balance of approximately {$11000.00} ( attachment 8 ). Bank attorneys know that no one can afford {$10000.00} in attorneys fees to fight an {$11000.00} loan. So even though they are well aware at this point of their error, they do not have to respond or resolve it. They just keep deducting the payments from my account. 
We finally had to purchase another car. Coincidentally, our new auto loan was placed with U.S. Bank. However, on this loan the bank is holding the title to the car until the loan is paid in full. They did not erroneous issue it to the seller, free of all liens, relying on the seller to transfer it to us and put the bank on the title as the lienholder after the funds were released. Additionally, the bank required us to have insurance so their asset was protected from loss. Banking rules, regulations and procedures are supposed to be the same by law for all customers. The banks error has put me in a financial hardship, trapped in debt with a loan secured by a vehicle that was damaged and that they gave away to a third party. Their error has me paying on a car that I can never own and would not want to own at this point. 
U.S. Bank touts as their registered trademark on their online banking site and in the signage in their banks : Were proud to be named a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not know what group gave them this name ; they do not say ; but if I knew, I would send them a copy of my complaint. The bank is certainly not being ethical in dealing with me. They are well aware of their error and are defrauding me by making me pay for a vehicle that they gave away to a third party and are ignoring my attorneys attempts to contact them. I am desperate and have exhausted all of my limited resources and am seeking immediate relief and your help to resolve the financial entrapment the bank has me in. Can you help me please? Thank you.

Managing the loan or lease,"From XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX, I fell on hard times and was unable to make on-time payments for my car loan. When I would get behind on a late payment, I would make the payment during the next billing cycle to clear up the past due balance.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"Correspondence with Diamonds International ( DI ) began XXXX XXXX, 2016, it is now XXXX XXXX, 2016, with still NO resolution. It has been a runaround of emails with DI, having me jump through their hoops to basically 'stall ' me or 'wear me out ' I believe. I purchased an item in good faith and was 'taken ' for {$6200.00}! TD is the issuing bank for my Diamonds International credit card. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I purchased, in good faith, a single Crown of Light diamond, XXXX ctw, which was originally part of a set of earrings ( Referral XXXX, XXXX XXXX, sold by # XXXX ). Your store in XXXX ( # XXXX ) put this into my wedding ring. I have your appraisal and paperwork listing the USD value of this XXXX earring 'stud ' alone, at {$9200.00}. I opened a DI credit account and have been paying on it since. 

My local jeweler is a certified in diamond grading, XXXX and a member of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. She was shocked at the price I paid for the Crown of Light diamond I now have in my wedding band. Her original appraisal of my ring ( complete set ) was {$5200.00}. ( My original setting is valued at {$2500.00}. ) The DI Crown of Light diamond I purchased ( originally part of an earring set ) alone was 'valued ' at {$9200.00} according to the DI "" appraisal '' I received when I purchased it. ( The reason I had it appraised when I did was because my home insurance carrier required an appraisal which included ring and new stone. Initially I 'trusted ' the DI store, XXXX XXXX and "" XXXX XXXX '' XXXX shopping consultant who 'approved ' this purchase as being legitimate. ) DI response : "" Our Terms and Conditions ( located on the back of your purchase receipt ) state that the diamond would need to be appraised by an independent gemologist or appraiser, whose sole business is appraisals only and does not buy or sell jewelry, and a copy of the appraisal must be submitted for review within 30-60 days after the date of the purchase. Since your purchase was made on XXXX XXXX 2016, you are unfortunately out of the warranty time for 3-4 months. However, I would like to know if you completed a formal written appraisal with your jeweler. "" XXXX XXXX, DI Customer Service Representative. 

To say I was shocked and angered is a complete understatement. I was emailed an 'approved ' list of DI 'appraisers ' which INCLUDED JEWELERS! This makes absolute no sense to me! I contacted a jeweler from the DI website who was near ( yet XXXX hours ' drive away ), who appraised the DI Crown of Light diamond alone at {$3000.00}. This appraisal was rejected by DI ( because it does not mention the XXXX of XXXX cut XXXX even though the jeweler is listed on their website as a contact. I was told to obtain yet ANOTHER appraisal by someone they recommended ( a jeweler! ). I contacted one of the once again 'approved ' DI appraisers/jewelers who indicated that the XXXX XXXX cut is very similar, and was sent copies of similar diamonds with prices for comparison sake. The Crown of Light diamond I purchased in XXXX was coming in about {$3000.00}. The 'appraisal ' I received when I purchased the diamond is, therefore, {$6200.00} INFLATED! Of course, this all takes time since the customer representative must 'check ' with her manager first. I recently learned that my claim was actually closed on XXXX/XXXX/2016 and we were still corresponding!! 

I have so far contacted DI, XXXX XXXX XXXX, the DI credit card and its issuer ( TD Bank ). No one has been able ( or willing ) to resolve this issue.

Upon reaching out regarding warranty an info email was sent to me. This email reflected incorrect start and expire mileage for the vehicle warranty. It was alarming because it appeared the warranty had expired based on mileage. I followed up and the company indicated that was the mileage reported by the bank at initiation of the contract. I would need to have the bank make the correction on their end. 
It seemed an easy fix. The bank confirmed correct mileage using car fax info and submitted the request only to discover i would have not been eligible to even purchase this plan because at the time the car mileage was above the cut off for the platinum plan. This is resulting in a {$500.00} increase to backdate and adjust to the gold plan which the warranty company agreed to. 
The gold plan is only covering about half the cost of repair -which I anticipated based on my purchase of the platinum plan that i would only be responsible for the deductible. With the comfort of my full warranty for XXXX miles i made the choice to keep this vehicle rather than trade it at which time the value of my car was very high. Now the value is lower and XXXX left with high rental car cost and {$2000.00} out-of-pocket repair. I feel the bank is responsible for this cost since I was unable to make informed decisions at XXXX XXXX of warranty purchase and subsequently since with regard to keeping the vehicle or not based on their error. The bank has denied request for reimbursement of out of pocket cost less the deductible. 
Thank you",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,7290649
Managing an account,"I opened a Cash App account 2 or 3 years ago and never had any issues. In XX/XX/2022, I got XXXX  in XXXX XXXX, GA. I had a roommate that stayed with me at my house in Florida. After I was XXXX, she took my car and went back down to my house, which I really didn't anticipate she would do since I wasn't there. She got into my belongings and found where I kept my account numbers and passwords. She changed the passwords and the recovery information so I was locked out of my accounts. She took around {$10000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX account which has been resolved. She also took a total of {$1100.00} from my Cash App account. I was given this amount from the first representative I spoke with on XX/XX/2022. Unfortunately, I did not become aware that this had been done to me until around the latter part of XXXX, which is why I was reporting it outside of their 60 day policy of disputing a transaction. Since XX/XX/2022, I have contacted Cash App support at XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX three other times with the representatives telling me it was being worked on. I thought this was strange because I was initially told I would hear something within 10 days and the case had up to 45 days to be resolved. They had never asked this entire time for any documentation from me ; so I asked them if it would help if I sent documentation to show what happened. They said yes, so in XX/XX/2022, I uploaded documentation to prove my story. I had to send it twice as they said they did not receive it the first time. Finally, on XX/XX/2022, I was told the case had been denied but I never received anything in regards to this via my email. I believe they are trying to string me along hoping I will just give up and go away. I only want my money reimbursed to me. I thank you for any help you can provide.",,6208227
Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Tx XXXX XXXX Early Warning XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AZ XXXX Consumer ID : XXXX Reported For : SUSPECTED FRAUD ACTIVITY ; ANY AMOUNTS OWED HAVE BEEN PAID Reported Name : XXXX XXXX Reported Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX REPORTED SSN/ID : XXXX Drivers License : XXXX STATE : TX Date of Closure : XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX / XXXX Original Charge Off Amount : {$220.00} Closure Status : PAID IN FULL Closure Status Date : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX EARLY WARNING, The above entry where SUSPECTED FRAUD ACTIVITY. is being reported by you ( EARLY WARNING ) from information you ( EARLY WARNING ) received from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. 

I have requested twice in the past 75 days that you validate this information with documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Validate or delete as soon as possible. In both instances you ( EARLY WARNING ) have failed to provide any documented proof that the data record you are reporting is accurate. Moreover, you claimed that I asked you to provide documentation or transactional data to validate the information. I need not explain to you ( EARLY WARNING ) that you simply house the information provided to you from institutions such as XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 

However, EARLY WARNING is required under FCRA to conduct thorough investigation which would include gathering documentation and/or statements from those have this information. When a investigation fails to produce accurate data and/or documentation as to the validity of the reporting record, that record must be deleted within the thirty day as prescribed by FCRA. 

EARLY WARNING has failed to provide the required documentation from XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and subsequently failed to delete the inaccurate information as requested by me the consumer. Since this demonstrates a pattern and behavior to disregard what FCRA has required you to do and remain a repository of accurate data of consumer records, EARLY WARNING is in violation of FCRA codes. 

Therefore, I am demanding that every record EARLY WARNING has on file with records to me be thoroughly investigated and validated with documentation and/or transaction records. Validate all of my records and data or delete every item or record that can not be validated that EARLY WARNING is reporting to and from other financial institutions. VALIDATE or DELETE, your only two options. 

A simple overdraft does not constitute fraud. Moreover, any fraudulent act must also demonstrate intent. This is why that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX must produce any and all documentation that would warrant suspected fraud. Suspected fraud without documentation is not fraud at all thus XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX intent is to cause harm to me the consumer in this case. When did XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX notify me, the consumer, of this adverse information as required under FCRA. This is something a thorough investigation would have discovered if EARLY WARNING had completed as described by FCRA. 

Since EARLY WARNING SYSTEM has repeated the inaccurate information, this has caused additional harm to me, the consumer. 

Provide me, the consumer, with valid documentation and/or data for every record you have on file about me or record of deletion where no documentation can be provided to EARLY WARNING from the reporting banking institution. Failure to do so will allow me seek legal damage for any and all records that EARLY WARNING has failed to validate and conduct thorough investigation.

This false information has caused me financial and mental harm since you ( EARLY WARNING ) has refused to correct or delete this false information. I am unable to open another checking account due to the SUSPECTED FRAUD ACTIVITY that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX has noted on this closed account without any documentation demonstrating fraudulent activity. I demand that XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX forward valid documentation of fraud or delete the account as required under FCRA.

Managing an account,"On or about XX/XX/2021 I received a text stating it was from the TDBank fraud department asking me if I submitted a payment in XXXX for {$500.00} it then stated if yes type YES and if no type NO, so I sent a text back stating NO. I then was told that our account had been hacked and that they were calling me, my phone then rang showing the TD 800 number and when I picked it up they asked for XXXX XXXX XXXX and told me it was the Fraud Department for TDBank and that my online accounts had been hacked and that I needed to log into my account and change my passwords. At that point I felt something was off so I hung up and called TDBank who told me they hadn't texted or called me, I was then instructed that they had to close all our accounts and that we needed to go to the Bank the next day to open new accounts., they also sent me to the Fraud Department to go over transactions that come out of our accounts on a monthly basis and for money desposited electronically into our accounts. I spent 2 1/2 hours on the phone with this girl and she assured me all was set and that we shouldn't have any problems getting our money and others getting paid. Well that was wrong for the next week I spend hours everyday on the phone with people explaining what happened and why the payments were returned. I was getting whacked with overdraw fees on both ends. I called XXXX at the Bank again and she just said oh I'm sorry let me check with the back office and see what happened. On XX/XX/2021 my husband and I went into our local Branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, we sat with XXXX for over an hour setting up all the new accounts. We had a Business Checking, a Personal Checking and a Savings account that were all linked together. After spending that amount of time there we were told everything was all set we could use the debit cards and the new accounts were ready to go. My husband went to the Supply house and tried to use his Debit card and it got Declined. I tried to use my card and it got declined, I then went online and tried to transfer money just to see if it worked and it didn't! I called XXXX at the Bank and she said Oh I don't know what happened the Back Office assured me everything was fine! XXXX never calls back I have to get up every morning and look at my account to see what's happened next in the mean time we couldn't use our accounts. A couple of days later I called and XXXX was off that day so clearly nothing was being done about our issues, so I asked for another Manager XXXX got on the phone and I explained what was going on she said oh my goodness let me check with our back office and see what is going on. XXXX called me back and said we were all set that there was an error made and it was fixed. 
The next morning I got up and saw that {$1100.00} had been reversed from our Savings account, I again called and got XXXX he stated that he had no idea why this happened and that he would check with the Back Office to see if they can investigate it.I got sick of waiting for XXXX and XXXX to call me back so I called the 800 customer service number and asked to speak with a Manager and I also asked for the number for Corporate I was told they will gladly give me an address to write a letter to them but there were no numbers to contact, the Manager finally picked up and called the local bank herself and spoke to XXXX who fixed some of the issues, they then put me on the phone with XXXX from the Fraud Department so she could help with the automatic payments/withdrawals being allowed to go through. When I spoke to XXXX XXXX told her I had a huge problems with girl I spoke to before and her comment to me was "" I am VERY good at my job '' well she wasn't because after spending another hour on the phone with her everything still bounced and TD Bank continued to charge me overdraft charges {$35.00} a whack! Up until today I still haven't received a straight answer to any of this, but I have received overdraft charges on all accounts, to many transfer charges due to them transferring money from one account to the new ones, XXXX was suppose to order me new check which she never did so I ordered them to the tune of {$48.00} which is ridiculous! I am still waiting for an answer to what the XXXX is going on with our accounts, the other day they went into my personal account and reversed my XXXX XXXX money of {$560.00} and again charged me {$35.00} overdraft. I am getting the run around and am extremely frustrated with all of this. I have spent hours of my time on phone calls, I have lost a good amount of money for their Security leak and am exhausted from all the work I have had to do to try and fix this issue. I NEED HELP PLEASE> As you can see the business account money was in there but for some reason they sat on his deposit and charged us XXXX in overdrafts even though the money was there!

Struggling to pay mortgage,"I fell behind on my mortgage because of this covid global pandemic in XXXX of XXXX. I have applied for assistance twice and am not getting the proper answers to my questions from my mortgage company. The reasons per Fay as to why I don't qualify are as follows : 1. REPAY PLAN - INCOME IS INSUFFICIENT 2. DEFERMENT - INVESTOR DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM ( XXXX XXXX ) 3. MODIFICATION - BASED ON INCOME, INCOME IS NOT SUFFICIENT, DEFICIT Problem # 1 - XXXX XXXX 's website clearly states that they offer deferments after a forbearance for their borrowers. Why am I not a candidate if XXXX XXXX has hired Fay to service my loan and XXXX XXXX is offering it to loans that they service? This question could not be answered by Fay Problem # 2 - I have a surplus income after my mortgage and bills are paid, THANK XXXX, not a deficit. My three month average for self employment income from XXXX was gross {$3500.00} and net was {$3000.00} but today I was told that the underwriter 's final net income was calculated at {$2200.00}, that is a difference of {$760.00}. When I asked why 25 % of my take home income was deducted by their office, the answer was "" I don't know that's what the letter shows '', when I asked who I can speak with to get clarity as to why that much is taken out of my pay, the answer was "" No one, we treat every homeowner the same ''. That is the strangest response and for me being a XXXX and minority in this county, I now am positive that I am being discriminated against. Really, you take off 25 % of everyones self employment income which then causes them not to be qualified for help?

"Managing, opening, or closing account","The issue relates to a BlueBird by American Express prepaid debit card ending in XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I returned some clothing items to a XXXX XXXX store in XXXX, VA in the amount of {$520.00} ( return receipts attached ). 
The original purchase was originally made on a different American Express card, and the BlueBird by American Express card at issue was mistakenly presented to the merchant for the return. The merchant processed the return to the BlueBird by American Express card/account in accordance with its own policies. 

The credit balance showed up on my BlueBird by American Express account within a day or XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, American Express informed me by email ( attached ) that it closed my account because it could not find corresponding debits to the {$520.00} in credits. The email from American Express further states that {$520.00} "" has been returned to the merchant. '' Almost 4 months later, despite over a dozen calls by me to American Express, the funds remain in my closed BlueBird account as of today ( XXXX XXXX, 2016 ) and have not been returned to the merchant. American Express readily admits this each time I call in : its representatives have stated each time that I have called that the funds remain in the account, that the account is closed, that the funds can not be returned to me, and that the funds will be returned to the merchant, without providing a timeline. Attempts to engage with American Express regarding the reasons for closing the account and/or remedying the situation have been unsuccessful. 

After almost 4 months, the merchant has not received the funds. Based on my discussions with the merchant, the merchant is not interested in retrieving the funds from American Express because the original items were paid for in full and subsequently returned in accordance with the merchant 's policies. American Express has been holding these funds for almost 4 months. I am requesting that a check in the amount of {$520.00} ( the account balance ) be sent to me immediately and the BlueBird account formally closed.",,2246786

Closing an account,"Disclosure : - I am dealing with this issue about 2 years now. 
- About XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is missing, Bank of America does not react. 
- I am XXXX but living in XXXX and USA and have a business in Florida. 
- My personal and business account are both at Bank of America - Due to my health and medical condition, I am unable to travel to USA ( since 2 years ) - My daughter is fully introduced to my problem and helps me with translation and documents. 

Short Summary of two long years while fighting with the Bank of America to unlock my blocked private account, which now turned into a closed account with no information about the remaining money on this savings account. ( About two years ago ) due to unknown reasons my personal account was blocked by BoA after transferring money from my business account to my private account. I contacted the BoA Service Hotline several times over the course of many months. Always the same answer : They do not know what caused the account to be closed, I need to wait, or this issue only can be fixed in person, and they can not unlock it. Due to my health and corona regulations, I was not able to travel to the US, and nobody suggested any other options. In my frustration I also sent letters with my issue to the BoA CEO, to the Customer Complaint Office and to the facility in XXXX XXXX where I opened the account. Never received an answer. In XX/XX/XXXX my daughter went to a facility in XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida ) to solve this issue in person and get more information how to unlock the private account. She had all necessary documents ( Signed power of attorney, all passport documents in original form, my personal and medical information, and banking cards ), yet the manager did not give her any information or options to solve the issue. But suggested that the account should be better closed since BoA no longer supports customer accounts were the account owner no longer lives in the US. Furthermore, the manager suggested that I should cancel the private account in written form with a notarization and stating that the remaining money will be transferred to the remaining business account. I sent the cancellation as a letter as described and the needed notarization with clear instruction to transfer the remaining money off the private account and to the business account with all necessary banking information. XXXXwo weeks later : The letter was successfully delivered to Bank of America ( tracking and tracing service was applied ). Status Quo until now : The private account is now closed, but the money was never transferred to the business account. I contacted the manager of the facility in XXXX XXXXl, she redirects me to the Service Hotline and tells me that she can not help. The Service Hotline ( called several times ) tells me the same ( can not help ) and there is no more record - I also asked to be directed to higher instances but they always decline the offer and tell me I need to wait - I am waiting for this money more than 5 month now. 


Summary of evidence and events : Starting from XX/XX/XXXX : Private Account was blocked and access via online banking denied. 
( Page 3 : XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX ) -> E-Mail to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX First contact person in XXXX  XXXX facility ) ( Page 4 : XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX ) -> Information that I need to come to the facility in the US ( impossible during Corona travel restriction and my declining health situation ) Multiple phone calls in between with XXXX XXXX XXXX and Customer Service Hotlines Always the same outcome : Nobody knows the exact reason why the private account was blocked, always got transferred to another department, no alternative to unlock unless I come to a BoA facility and all access denied. 
Customer Service then told me to wait to resolve the issues ( 4 Month of waiting no solution ) Called Customer Service again. Now being connected to the Fraud Centre Hotline, accused of fraud but no explanation why or what happened. Employee transferred me to another fraud detection employee, but also no information, record, or further information why I am being accused or what caused this to happen : I need to go to the facility to resolve it myself and hung up. Followed by more phone calls- always explaining that I can not go to US due to corona travel restrictions and I need another solution. 
My health condition got worse, and I paused my further actions. 

( Page 5 : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) -> Fist E-Mail of Security Alerts : transactions were declined ( I had no access to any online login, online banking or account information and my card was blocked too! ) Acted and called Customer Service to cancel any transaction and get more information about the status. 
No information or answer and I got transferred to fraud department again, telling me that there is no clear information why I am being accused, but saw that there were several transactions within the last month but since I never declined or stated that something was wrong no actions were taken ( How could I know this? since I had no access to this account in any way, I was not even able to get account information about transactions or payments at all ) The employee told me he will investigate and call back He never called back! 
( Page 6/7 : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) -> Security Alerts : transactions were declined. 
Called the Hotline again - Same outcome. After that I never received any Alert E-Mails again. 
Between XXXX and XXXX, I called the Service Hotline and also send medical records that I can not go to the US and Corona was still present. Always the same conversation : Nobody knows the exact reason why the private account was blocked, always got transferred to another department, no alternative to unlock unless I come to a BoA facility and all access denied.

All documents were in original form, as well as my and her passports, signed power of attorney, handwritten approval to give her information and access to both of my accounts, medical report and explanation why I am unable to travel and credit cards in original form. 

The XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) at the facility in XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cape XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX ) denied her access and all information and just told her that I need to be there in person, there is no other option! She then told my daughter that this account should be closed since BoA does not supports accounts where the account owner no longer lives in the US. And this can be done in written form with a letter stating the wish to close the account ( signed and authorised by the notary ) and that the remaining money then will be sent to an account stated in this letter.

After the claim was investigated, we were sent a letter claiming that the location of the original transaction was located, but that the check itself was not found. 

I am aware that these atms are equipped with video recording for security purposes, so video of me and my husband inserting said check must have been viewed to verify the location of the incident. As to why the check in question was unable to be located is something i can not understand, given that the check itself would have my name and adresss since it is employer issued. 

As a result, the credit issued by the bank is now being removed on XX/XX/XXXX.

Closing your account,"I have three credit card accounts with Capital One that have been closed. I believe this adverse action is a retaliatory act against me exercising my right to accept my remittance coupon and instruct it to be applied to my account for payment. For account one, On XX/XX/2023, I sent Capital One an accepted payment/remittance coupon for {$3000.00}. I also provided them with a notarized Power of Attorney ( attached below ) acting as agent to my principal 's account. I included instructions ( attached below ) to apply the principal 's balance to the principal 's account for set-off each cycle. I also included the Federal Reserve Act Section 16 as support that my instructions were lawful, with all notes being obligations of the United States. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from Capital One Customer Care Team ( attached below ) addressed to the principals account, and not the natural person/agent who requested the written correspondence, and provided the Power of Attorney over the principals account. Capital One made the claim that You are currently listed on this account as primary account holder. As primary account holder, you have full access to the account. I believe this to be a deceitful attempt to ignore my Power of Attorney stating that the natural person is acting as agent to the principals account, by sending correspondence to the principals account and stating that the principal does have full access to the account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One sent correspondence ( attached below ) to my principals account stating, We are closing this account because activity on this or another account is not consistent with our expectations for account usage and violates the Capital One Customer Agreement. Please stop using this account immediately and destroy any cards and checks associated with it. Also, you should update any recurring payments you have set up using this account You are still responsible for paying the full amount of any remaining account balance and youll continue to receive billing statements until the balance reaches XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a reply to Capital Ones correspondence ( attached below ) clarifying the definitions of capacity I was acting in with the Power of Attorney I submitted. I also enclosed multiple supporting documents such as the FDIC Revised Policy Statement on Securities Lending to support my claims. I also noticed in my portal for Capital One App that the subject line for one of their letters they mailed me was Generic Letters, which led me to believe they found my instructions to be generic, so in my letter mailed on XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote a handwritten letter and clarified any confusion regarding generic letters. I requested a written explanation for my account being restricted, and informed them that I believed they were in violation of 42 USC 12203- Prohibition Against Retaliation and Coercion. I also requested proof of accounting. I concluded with giving Capital One five days to provide remedy by following my original instructions of transferring the principals balance to the principals account each month for set off. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondence from Capital One stating Thank you for contacting us about the terms on your Capital One Walmart Rewards Card account. Your current terms are listed below on the following pages : Capital One failed to provide me with a specific explanation as to why my account was restricted, or proof of accounting. 

For Capital One account two, on XX/XX/2023, I mailed them a written letter stating there was a billing error in requesting me to send a portion of my statement and a check or one money order I went on to express that, Once I have enclosed and accepted my payment coupon, it should act as the payment/tender/financial instrument itself. Before I had an opportunity to mail this letter to Capital One, on XXXX XXXX they had already taken adverse action against me and closed my account ( letter attached ). They also closed my third account and sent written correspondence that was written on XX/XX/2023.",,6764938
Fees or interest,"I have been a Capital One credit card holder for at least two years. I opened this account as my first credit card when I was in my final year of college. I believe it was, at once point, associated with my status as a Student. I am 13 months out of college at this moment and have almost always ( at least for the past 12 months ) paid the complete amount on time. I have never spent over my limit ( or even come close ) or been more than a few days late, if at all. In late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX I closed my checking/savings with a small local bank ( Institution for Savings in XXXX, MA ) and opened a new checking/savings account with XXXX XXXX. I immediately linked this account to my Capital One account so I could continue paying my monthly credit cards bills on time. Unbeknownst to me at this time, the XXXX XXXX account was somehow not added to my Capital One account, but instead a XXXX XXXX XXXX account was added. I do not currently nor have I ever had any kind of account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not know how this account was added. I did not consciously done. Because this account, not my XXXX XXXX account, was added, the auto-payments from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX defaulted and did not go through. As such, the account accrued both late fees and interest charges from both of these months. There was no effort made by Capital One to inform me of these default payments, despite 2 years of history and and an exceptional record of on-time payments. Today, I logged onto my mobile account and saw these fees and charges for the first time. Thinking it was a misunderstanding, I called the customer service number. They informed me of the XXXX XXXX XXXX accounts, which, as you can imagine, was a huge surprise to me. The company then led me on a 2 hour, 7 person, 2 dropped call goose chase to get answers. In the end, no one was able to help me.

Payoff process,"We received a bill in XX/XX/XXXX with a New balance for the month. We paid the full balance before the due date and did not use the card for any additional charges for the month. When we received the XX/XX/XXXX bill, which we expected to be {$0.00} since we paid the full amount, we were shocked to see that the company, Chase Card Services was charging us {$80.00} for interest. 

Obviously, we want the charges for the {$80.00} additional in interest removed from our bill, as we paid the full amount due before the due date. I am not sure why they would show you a new balance and expect to be able to charge you interest on it when you pay it in full.

Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"In XX/XX/2021 we applied and were approved for a loan at enerbank on what was called a 12 month same as cash loan.

We were ready to pay it off and I called to see what the payoff amount was and lo and behold, the 12 month same as cash expired. we did not get a letter advising us it was about to expire like MOST companies do.

Struggling to repay your loan,"I have 4 individual XXXX Student loans and 2 federal student loans serviced by Navient ( the private lender was XXXX XXXX ). 

I began XXXX school at XXXX XXXX in the fall of XXXX, graduating in XXXX. I landed my first job in XX/XX/XXXX working as a XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXX making approximately {$28000.00} per year. I was employed by XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

My scheduled monthly student loan payment was more than I could afford- I brought home approximately {$620.00} every 2 weeks and my monthly payment at that time was approximately {$900.00} per month. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX ( now Navient ) regarding my repayment options. Initially, I was told that I could obtain a forbearance, which required payment of a fee. Periodically, I had to request a forbearance until I had received the maximum number of forbearances and could no longer obtain one. 

After I exhausted the forbearances, I once again contacted Navient about my options. I was told that I could do an extended repayment, with interest-only payments for a set number of years ( I believe it was 4 ). Afterwards, the payment would increase. When I asked what if my income was not sufficient in 4 years to afford the increased amount of the required payments, I was told that the extended repayment was my only option. 

From XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I was unemployed. I contacted Navient about my options and was told that I had none but to repay my loan as I had exhausted my forbearances. ( I was permitted to defer my federal loans during this time. ) I had no choice but to not make payments during this time ; however, I made all past due payments and brought my loan current by XX/XX/XXXX. 

Not once when I contacted Navient about repayment options did anyone offer or speak to me about income based repayment. Nor did Navient make clear to me that each time I received a forbearance or could n't make a payment, the loan interest would be capitalized into the loan principal. 

Because of capitalized interest, I now owe an extra {$38000.00} on my private loans, which is 54 % of the amount borrowed from XXXX XXXX to fund my education. 

I graduated 14.5 years ago, but owe more on my student loans that I did the day I graduated. 

My monthly loan payment is more than my monthly housing and car costs combined. 

Based on Navient 's estimated pay-off dates, I will be XXXX when I finish paying my loans. 

My credit has suffered, and because of the large required payments, I have n't been able to save for retirement. 

When I went to XXXX school I knew nothing about student loans or their terms. ( My undergraduate education was funded mainly through scholarships and grants. ) It took more time standing in line in the financial aid office than it took to complete the loan paperwork. I did n't even sit down, but signed the documents handed to me in the lobby. When I asked "" what if I ca n't repay these [ loans ]? '' I was told "" you 'll be able to '', I should have asked more questions. I was the first person in my family to go to college, let alone graduate school- I was too ignorant to know what questions to ask and was simply excited to be there and wanted to attend so badly, I would have signed anything. 

It 's probably too late to help me, but I want others to learn from my mistakes and save themselves from the experiences I 've had.",,2675176

Managing the loan or lease,"I took out a loan with Santander Consumer USA in XX/XX/XXXX. They gave me this loan which LITERALLY set me up for failure. I got XXXX  a couple months after I purchased the car and was put on XXXX for the duration of my XXXX due to XXXX Then XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX while I had an infant. I ran into some hard times upon which they repossessed my car without any notice which gratefully my Aunt paid to help me get my car back. Upon getting help with those hardship times they made me sign pages upon pages of paperwork. My Aunt has worked in mortgage loans her whole life, which although a bit different, she understands car loans very well. I have been making payments forever and it doesn't seem like my payments are ever touching the principle. So, I gave my Aunt my transaction history and asked her to go over my loan and help me understand. They gave me a loan for XXXX on a XXXX vehicle with a payment of {$550.00} a month. First of all, I was in a tough place at the time that I got the car, in fact, I was only doing side jobs to make money, I didn't even provide them with proof of income. My Aunt looked at everything I sent her and discovered that my interest rate is fluxuating when the contract I signed was a fixed interest rate. Also, they have my term end for XXXX of XXXX, which if you calculate my remaining debt of {$15.00}, XXXX at {$550.00} a month, EVEN IF the entire payments went to principle, it will NOT be paid off at the maturity date they have on my account. AND WE KNOW that there will be interest. So, my Aunt advised that I call Santander and request copies of all documents on my file which contain my signature - and they refuse to give me anything except the contract which I informed them that I already have my dealer copy. When I asked Santander about the maturity date and debt still owed not adding up- they said they have made modifications to my loan. Which again, they refuse to provide me copies of. I have gathered that I WILL NEVER get this car paid off because when I do my calculations, almost my entire $ 551 monthly is going to interest. I asked Santander if I was supposed to be qualified for the Class Action Suit they had and they told me my vehicle loan was not obtained during the time frame of that suit. I told them that my vehicle was purchased on XX/XX/XXXX and the ending date of the lawsuit time window was XXXX of XXXX. The customer service rep shuttered at my knowledge and still insisted that either way, I did not qualify. I am at a loss because not only has my XXXX XXXX XXXX had 3 major breakdowns leaving me without a vehicle causing me hardships and barely runs at this point, but also I cant seem to get it paid off so that I can get myself and my XXXX XXXX XXXX into a safe and reliable vehicle. Can you help me PLEASE? I am desperate to end this madness with this car and loan because this car has literally almost XXXX XXXX XXXX and me many times due to all of the engine/transmission issues but I also cant get the loan paid off because they have my loan set up to where they charge me however much interest they want, seem to add whatever fees they want and modify the loan without any knowledge to me.

Trouble using your card,"My wife and I received a {$5500.00} credit limit on a store card from XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CT, managed by TD Bank. We made some initial purchases and had over {$2000.00} available credit remaining. We set up autopay immediately and had been making on time payments for months. One month we started a new joint bank account and I neglected to change the autopay information with the XXXX TD Bank card, so the payment was declined. I quickly resolved the issue once I noticed the problem. Literally every other payment thereafter was on time via autopay. However, Our entire remaining available balance was deleted due to the once single circumstantial late payment. 

I called TD Bank to see if they could help, but they were unwilling to reconsider. 

This seems to me a very unfair practice. I would understand if there had been multiple late payments, etc, but other than the one late payment due to a change in bank accounts, every other payment was on time and I assumed we were in good standing.

However, Klarna took 25 % of my purchase total out of my bank knowing they were not going to approve my order. Then it takes up to seven days to put back in my account. The agent said and I quote, the system automatically puts the money on hold just by trying to create the order to confirm that you have enough money for the first payment before the store processes the purchase. So knowing my order was more than they would approve they took 25 % of the purchase cost out of my account for up to a week. This happened today on XX/XX/23.

Closing an account,"I have been a customer and loyal user of Simple bank for many years. Simple was a "" neobank '' which provided a unique, progressive approach to budgeting and bank account management, and has helped many customers, myself included, get out of debt. It was bought by BBVA USA several years ago, and XXXX transitioned to provide the FDIC-insured accounts for customers of Simple. 

A merger between XXXX and BBVA USA was announced last year, and news of this was communicated to customers of Simple. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Simple communicated to its customers that, as part of this merger, the service was being shut down and that account-holders would transition to traditional XXXX accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX of this year, access to the Simple app, along with the various features that have helped many customers get out of debt, will be shut down. Account holders will be given traditional accounts with higher fees and an app with less features. 

Although I'm sure that these actions are not illegal, it feels like they should be. A ( virtual ) board room of bank executives should not be able to make a unilateral decision that affects hundreds of thousands if not millions of people and forces them to seek out other solutions which are not as technologically mature or functionally equivalent.
