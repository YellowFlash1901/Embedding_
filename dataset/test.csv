Struggling to pay mortgage,"As owners of the property, XXXX XXXX and I approached Rushmore Loan Management Services several times to make an offer to settle the mortgage. XXXX . XXXX is the sole mortgage holder, but she has signed several powers of attorney giving me authority to speak on her behalf with XXXX, and she has told XXXX staff person XXXX XXXX to speak with me. I have spoken regularly with him, but he has been unwilling to help. 

First, he said repeatedly that he would set up an appraisal that I would pay for ( which I agreed to ), but he has never followed through. Second, XXXX . XXXX has qualified for a modification, but once he started dealing with me, he cancelled that modification. Third, every time a court date approaches, he calls to say he wants to resolve the matter and makes promises that he doesn't keep. Then at court the lawyer for XXXX tells the court that they are working with us, which isn't true. Fourth, I have arranged for potential buyers, including XXXX XXXX, a real estate investor. Although XXXX XXXX began a conversation with XXXX XXXX, when he learned that I was involved with obtaining this buyer, XXXX XXXX changed his mind, even after XXXX XXXX submitted all kinds of information, everything XXXX XXXX asked for. Fifth, I made an offer myself and, at XXXX XXXX 's request, submitted proof of funds. Yet he has refused to negotiate and make counter offers. Sixth, he continues to go back to XXXX . XXXX  even though she has told him repeatedly that she does not want to keep the unit and wants him to speak with me. 

We have wanted again and again to settle this matter. The judge keeps telling both sides that he wants us to resolve this before the next court date in XXXX. I am obtaining the transcript from the last two hearings where the judge has told us to get this settled and will forward it to the CFPB when I have it. Yet, XXXX has brushed me off again and again. XXXX XXXX has tried to side step working with me. He has made this personal and has been very disrespectful to me over the phone. His attitude has been very unprofessional.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,2850250
"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","Escrow payment went up and I made a payment for the old amount ( accidentally ). I realized the error of my ways and paid the added escrow amount. During the time I made the XXXX payment and the XXXX for the escrow account, the bank did not apply the payment to the mortgage. I called to register a complaint about this practice and the agent put me on hold as he tried to figure out the issue, though I already explained to home what happened. Once he called someone to figure out what I explained, he tried to explain to me what happened, which was not accurate. He said they did not hold on to my payment and not apply. Then he realized the error and explained it correctly. I asked repeatedly to register my complaint and all he wanted to tell me is that is how the process works. I even said I was going to the CFPB and he still would not acknowledge filing my complaint. Throughout all of this he said if a customer makes an overpayment that they will not apply the funds to principal until a full payment is made ( principle and escrow ). Th is not acceptable for a bank to hold on to funds when they should apply to the outstanding balance. It is also not acceptable for someone to have to spend XXXX trying to log a complaint and receive push back from the telephone agent. He made a bad experience worse",,1338814
Struggling to pay mortgage,"We had a mortgage with Bank of America then it was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX. At this time my husband was very ill with XXXX XXXX and wasn't able to work. He went on Social Security/XXXX and we were given a modification. We were told at the time that our interest rate would be 2 % as part of a government program. Then the loan was sold again and the interest rate went to 4 %. We couldn't afford the 4 % or the new loan amount they gave us. My husband was still on XXXX. He kept corresponding with the bank until we had a court hearing in XX/XX/XXXX. During that hearing we once again told the lawyer for the bank that we couldn't afford what they were proposing and we were still on a trial payment plan with them. They wanted to proceed with foreclosure at that hearing but instead filed a Voluntary Stipulation of Dismissal. My husband was handling the paperwork but he died while in the hospital on XX/XX/XXXX. I am now trying to get this all sorted out as I want to keep my house. The last statement I could find from The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was for XX/XX/XXXX. Again, we have not been to court since XX/XX/XXXX, nor have I received an eviction notice. This past week I received a letter from a realtor saying we have to give her the keys. I did receive a letter from the banks attorney titled Section 3 Notice for Posting and Delivery. 
I need help sorting this out and when I do review the bank statements from XX/XX/XXXX, to try and figure out what is owed they are all different amounts but one this for sure is the mortgage interest is astronomical.

Taking/threatening an illegal action,"I was paying Fein, Such, Kahn and Shepard a XXXX a month payment since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In XXXX XXXX I ran into financial issues and called them initially to stop the payments. A paralegal named XXXX stated that I needed to write a letter. I wrote a letter and stating I needed to stop payments until XXXX of this year. They claim they tried to contact me and sent me letters. I verified that they did receive my letter and they still seized y bank account in XXXX XXXX even though I had been paying them and wrote them a letter. After I spoke to XXXX he said I was in default when I did what he asked. They then tried to continue payments even after he told me I was in default and that they did n't accept my letter. When I called the court they told me the lawyer also re-filed against me for XXXX when the original debt was only XXXX and I had paid down XXXX of it.

Taking/threatening an illegal action,A debt collector by the name of rodenburg law firm in North Dakota has threatened to sue me for a credit card that fell into debt because of hardship in which the original creditor knew it was being closed for that reason. This debt collector tried serving me papers at my previous address and their representative harrassed my parents there in the process. I then got in contact with this debt collector erxplaining I am experiencing hardship and explained that the original creditor knew of the hardship. I tried to work with the debt collector in telling them I could only give so money so much each month but they refused my offer. THEY REFUSED MONEY FROM ME. They are still attempting to SUE ME when I have nothing and still experiencing hardship and receive public assistance which in some states that could prevent the debt collector from attempting to garnish wages.

This has been almost 90 days. I sent them facts ( proof ) that they were not being 100 % truthful about their reinvestigation. And they could not show me any paperwork from the court making me liable for this information they were reporting about me.

Struggling to repay your loan,"Thank you for reading this email and hopefully you can assist me in this area. I have student loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which are serviced by American Education Services disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. These loans total approximately {$25.00} and I have been trying real hard since I retired in XXXX of XXXX to continue to make these monthly payments. Unfortunately I have run into financial difficulty, now on a fixed income and have called A.E.S.to arrange a lower payments. I was informed that I have to write letters to the lenders of these loans, which was completed asking both lenders to lower the monthly payments. I received replies of "" unable to grant your request '' from both lenders. I again called A.E.S. again to find additional solutions and they tried to get me a "" Modified Graduated Repayment Schedule '', which also was denied. I have run into a brick wall with this situation. I have offered to make lessor monthly payments to continue to pay something on these loans where the extra money will assist me with my mortgage payments. The only option they offered was a 'Hardship ' for one ( 1 )  year, which to me does not help the issue much, and to re-finance the loans for 25 years. I ask for help and guidance in this matter and look forward to addressing my concerns about how we as a Country struggle with defaulted student loans when the lenders of these type of loans fail to help the borrowers when in need. Again I look forward in talking with someone from your office.",,2857827
Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,"Dear Sir or Madam, 1. XXXX XXXX XXXX Account Number:XXXX*** Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

I immediately disputed this information with XXXX XXXX XXXX and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request. If you do not respond within this time period, per the FCRA, you must remove this negative information.

Late fee,"I opened a "" Kohl 's '' charge account which I always have paid more than the amount due. I did not always receive my bill on time, a few times I had been late. I found that I was being charged more than what I owed because of them adding a very high late charge, when I had already sent in the payment. The last time I got XXXX of these late charges I paid it with a small balance on my account. I owed nothing. Next thing I know they send me a bill with a late charge as the balance and a interest amount on top of it. I contacted them and told them what was going on and they just kept trying to collect it, I then received another bill and a phone call, on the call I explained to them what had happened and they told me that there was nothing they could do. I asked to speak to a supervisor, when I did I explained that my bill was already paid off in whole and that their whole balance was in late charges added after the fact. She said she would take XXXX fee off but not the other. I told her I would not pay either XXXX. I recently received another bill with the amount showing an additional charge for delinquency and they also reported me to the credit agencys to drop my credit score. This is why I stopped getting credit cards prior. This kind of abuse of their using my account to try to make money they are not owed. I also told them that I would not pay for late charges after my bill had already been paid in full and I was reporting them.",,2079824
Dealing with your lender or servicer,"Received a FCRA notice from Navient alleging a possible collection action, so in response I filed a request for Validation under FCRA. I requested that Navient prove the debt by supplying me with the promissory note between Navient and I.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","In XXXX I filed Ch XXXX and Wells Fargo was my mortgage holder. They were notified of the Ch XXXX and instead of WF filing the correct paperwork for my mortgage to be paid by the Trustee, another bank filed to claim the mortgage. After several attempts to get WF to file the correct paperwork, the Trustee dismissed their mortgage claim XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX a lawsuit was filed against WF to produce the original note. XX/XX/XXXX a settlement agreement was reached. Due to WF failing to file the agreement paperwork with the CH XXXX court in a timely manner, the mortgage restart date was moved from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX and the amounts owed for pre and post petition arrears was changed to reflect this additional 3 months of waived interest. The order setting all this in motion was accepted by the CH XXXX court XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Trustee sent a payment that was for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX to WF in XX/XX/XXXX. WF used the contractual due dates of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and applied the payments to months that were part of the pre and post petition arrears instead of applying to the Post Due Date as agreed in the CO and SA. These payments were made on XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX WF again paid the XX/XX/XXXX Pre petition payment with funds from the {$4500.00} arrears payment made by the Trustee. The remainder of the {$4500.00} was set into an unapplied status. On XX/XX/XXXX WF paid XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX again with money from the unapplied funds in an attempt to comply with a Notice of Cure sent to WF by the Trustee. They paid the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX mortgages again when those months had already been paid mistakenly using Trustee monthly payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. They continued to pay the months that were included in the SA and CO with monies sent for the current post petition due dates until XXXX XXXX. 

WF used unapplied funds in the amount of {$340.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to make a partial payment to my account. I mistakenly counted it as XXXX XXXX payment. I realize that money was actually the principal payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX that was never applied correctly. I have made all payments owed to WF since the last Trustee payment made XX/XX/XXXX. Single payments in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and double payments in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Currently I am due for XXXX XXXX, XXXX payment. However, WF still says I am behind. 

WF never waived the interest as the SA and CO instructed and even though they filed a Response to the Notice of Cure XX/XX/XXXX saying all monies had been received, WF says I owe them over {$1300.00} in arrears. Due to WFs failure to follow the SA and CO, I was unable to reaffirm my mortgage with them when I filed for Ch XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Now they have stopped sending monthly statements, have stopped reporting my payments to the credit bureaus, show me as surrendering our home, and send someone out monthly to tell me that I am behind in my mortgage, subject to foreclosure, make sure we live in the home, and tell us to call WF. With the wrong amount owed and all the credit bureau mistakes, it is impossible for me to refinance my loan and get away from WF. WF sent HARP paperwork this week demanding I submit a packet to have the mortgage refinanced at the wrong amount. I never requested this. I feel this is harassment for them failing to follow the SA and CO.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2105224
Closing your account,"Im XXXX I made a payment of {$120.00}, about 5 days later citi bank charged me again the same amount. I called citi bank and XXXXne of your employees apologized and refunded me back one of the payments. The next month I was charged a {$25.00} fee for a return check. I called and they said they would return the the fee and apologize because you were the ones that refunded me. I then learned next month that you turned my autopay off because you accused me of a return check even though it was your company that refunded that payment because you doubled charged me. I also found out that you never took the fee off. So the next day after my payment was due ( when I found out ) I called and the lady apologized again took off the return fee and said she would take off the late fee. I Immediately Told her to turn my auto pay back on and to run this months payment. Come to find out she only ran half of what was due for that month and she never reversed the late fee. NOW I found out that you closed my account because of the whole return payment may I remind you again that your employee refunded me one of the 2 payments you took out of my account because you double charged my account and she apologized saying it was your fault!

Fraud or scam,"On XX/XX/2021, I took advantage of a "" free trial '' offer for checking my credit reports from all three bureaus. The free trial was presumably offered by XXXX, which appeared to be a credit report provider. The free trial was for one week. 
The policy requires that one must cancel by the end of the free trial in order to avoid any charges, because the free trial automatically rolls into a paid monthly subscription of XXXX per month. 
On XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, I checked my credit card through online banking, and observed that the company had already charged my card the XXXX monthly fee, even though the free trial was not over. Since the charge was pending, I assumed that this was merely a pre-authorization that would be removed when I cancelled. 
On the morning of XX/XX/2021, I went to the website and logged in so that I could cancel the membership. I scrolled through my billing, account, and membership info and did not find a way to cancel. I then found out on the website that I needed to call the company 's XXXX number and speak to a service rep in order to verbally request to cancel. I find it suspicious that they require cancellations to be verbal. This removes the possibility of consumers having written or printable proof of their cancellation. 
I called the company at that time. During the hour long phone call, I spoke to a service representative with a foreign accent and informed him that I wanted to cancel. He attempted to convince me to change my mind, and seemed reluctant to fulfill my request. I continued to repeat my request to cancel at the end of the trial. He continued to ask me questions to retain me as a customer, even though I already knew that I would not use the service and didn't want it. Initially, he would not agree to cancel my subscription after the trial and he argued with me. He was aggressive. 
Finally, after an extended conversation in which I repeated my request half a dozen times, he relented and agreed to cancel. He told me that my membership was cancelled and he was submitting a request for a refund. He said that "" if '' it is approved, I would see the funds back in my account in a few days. He also told me that the charge was still pending, so it might take longer. He told me that refunds are not guaranteed. I was shocked that a refund was not guaranteed, when the charge was for a service that I hadn't used, didn't want, and I cancelled on time. I was surprised that the company might charge me for a service that I didn't receive. Some time after that call, I received an automated email from the company asking how they did. I did not respond. I also received an email that paradoxically stated "" this message is to confirm that your XXXX account has been cancelled as of XX/XX/2021. Beginning XX/XX/2021, you will no longer have access to your latest credit reports and scores or XXXX monitoring. '' On XX/XX/2021, I had received no further correspondence from the company. I checked my online banking account again to see if the refund had been issued yet. I had not yet received my money back. Instead, the charge had posted to my account. 
Then I navigated to their website and logged in, so I could see the status of my cancellation and refund request. The website gave no indication that I had cancelled at the end of the free trial. Instead, it said that I was good until approx. XX/XX/XXXX, and this was my next billing date. I was upset. 
I called the company again. I used the phone number provided on the website again. After another lengthy call with two people ( a rep and a supervisor ) with a foreign accent, I felt that the issue might still not be resolved, even though they told me it had. They told me they had no indication that I had previously cancelled. They told me that the charges were still pending and I had not been charged. But, the charge WAS completed and I HAD cancelled previously. This was much the same as I had heard the first time I called. So after the call with them, I called a different number for the company. 
After hanging up, I called the number provided on my bank statement. It was the same menu, but this time I was transferred to a service rep with an American accent. Once again, I explained the entire situation and that I wanted to cancel after the free trial and I had done so, but my request was not honored. At that time, I also requested a refund for the {$1.00} that was charged to my card at the start of the free trial to "" verify '' my card. The XXXX dollar was supposed to be a temporary pre-auth just to verify that the card was active ( this is common for companies that offer free trials ) so I was not surprised by it. However, I WAS surprised that the charge was posted to my card as an actual fee. I was told that it is refundable, but must be requested. Also, I was told that the charge is only able to be refunded if someone cancels after the free trial and no longer uses the service. 
In the afternoon of XX/XX/2021, I received an email from the company telling me that they were so happy I chose to reverse the cancellation and keep my membership. I was shocked, and replied with an angry email. ( After visiting the site again at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, it paradoxically states that my account is "" inactive ''. It offered me another "" free trial ''. No thank you! ) I then looked up the company on XXXX, to see if anyone else had problems with the company. I navigated to the XXXX, where I found hundreds of other complaints with the same or similar experiences. Some people had been charged unexpectedly MONTHS after cancelling. I clicked to go to the company webpage, where I found out that the real name in fact is XXXX XXXX, XXXX based in Texas. It is listed as an internet marketing company, not a more heavily regulated "" financial service '' /credit repair service. This is in spite of advertising that use of their service can help people improve their scores. 
Later in the evening, I received another email from the company stating that my refund request for the {$1.00} was approved. Okay, but where is my other refund? The one for XXXX? I have received no correspondence from the company regarding them giving my money back, except for the email that informed me they were so happy I chose to stay with their family- except I didn't choose that. I find the service useless. I get nothing that I can't get from XXXX for a lower cost. Due in large part to the fact that a bulk of their XXXX website services appears to be outside the scope of their normal business activities, and that it is an internet marketing company, XXXX appears to be merely a data collection company operating under a false pretense of a credit repair company with a simple XXXX web app that reposts credit reports and scores. I do not feel comfortable or safe with them having all of my personal information. I do not want them selling/distributing ANY of my information to any third party. I will submit a fraud alert to all 3 major credit bureaus after I file this report. 
At approx. XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to call my card issuing bank and submit a dispute on the charge. I made a report, and also informed them that I planned on reporting the company to the FTC, because this seems to be a scam, or fraudulent business practices. 
I am lucky that I have flexible business hours and I work primarily from home on a salary, so I am able to spend all of this time and effort to cancel, get my money back, dispute the charges, report this, and place a fraud alert on my credit reports. Most people can not. The amount of hoops they make people jump through, and the level of difficulty for customers to cancel at the end of the free trial ( or ever ), makes cancellation untenable for most people, much less the additional steps I have taken. If I worked at XXXX, I would not have been able to do everything that I did. The sad thing is, this is a company that promises the ability to check one 's credit scores and reports and improve them, so people who are wage workers with little time and few resources are the ones most likely to sign up and provide all of their personal data. The company reels us in with the promise of a free week trial, only to collect consumers CC and ALL private info ( SS #, home address, full name ), then charges people for services they don't receive and makes it extremely difficult to get the money back. The fact that many consumers report fraudulent charges months after cancelling is bothersome. This is enough to convince me of a scam. 
I am a business owner myself, and I run a small company that accepts CC payments. I am familiar with running CCs, so I know that companies can easily run a {$1.00} pre-auth to test the card instead of a charge. People should not have their cards CHARGED {$1.00}, {$.00}, or even {$.00} for what they state is FREE. 
I have taken the steps to become XXXX  compliant. The question is why are they storing people 's financial account information without express permission, months after the people are no longer doing business with them? I would NEVER think of retaining former customer 's card information after they have ceased to do business with me. There is something wrong about this. It is unlawful, and violates XXXX  industry standards.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","Our mortgage was sold to Carrington Mortgage Services in XXXX. After we sent in our XXXX payment, Carrington lost {$100.00} of the payment. They could not account for it, and they did not know where it went. After numerous phone calls, they finally agreed to look into it. It took Carrington more than XXXX weeks to correct it, and they still offered me no explanation as to what happened. 
This is when it gets fun! To correct the problem, Carrington deducted a whole additional payment ( {$1200.00} ) from my checking account Without notification or my permission. They were able to do this because they made an electronic-funds-transfer from my original check, and then they also deposited the actual paper check ( same check number too! ). Needless to say, XXXX mortgage payments withdrawn in 32 days overdrew my account. After racking up NSF bank fees for three days, Carrington quietly deposited the money back in my checking account with the notation "" check pymt PCF ''. They did n't even attach their name to the transfer. I called Carrington as soon as I found out about this, and all they had to say was "" They could n't understand why I made a payment in the middle of the month? '' They could see the extra money, but "" there 's no way that they initiated the transfer ''. The woman said that there was nothing they could do. She suggested that I send Carrington "" All my bank statements, dating back to XXXX '' XXXX? Are you kidding me? You want some DNA too? Maybe my ATM PIN?

Late fee,"I been paying my Macy 's Star Rewards card on time every month for years. I would submit a payment weeks before the due date.

I explained to them that i did n't get any notice in the mail about the changes. They said they has a policy change so i asked what is the policy change and they put me on hold for a long time to get someone to answer that question. I got passed around to numerous representatives that could n't tell me the policy, was giving me different amounts on my bill. I was very frustrated! They even kept hanging up on me and being rude. Finally a nice and knowledgeable representative came on and helped me resolved this problem. The representative told me i was never late on payments also read the dates that i paid which was way on time before the due date. So she waived my pass due amount because i was never sent a notice on this policy change. I made a payment of my usual monthly but not the policy change monthly which was {$27.00} dollars due to not knowing. I was also upset at the previous phone representatives lack of knowledge, rudeness, and they blamed me for their mistakes. A phone rep told me "" You made a payment on time but Macy 's applied it after the due date why is that? '' In my mind i was thinking, you should tell me it 's your mistake.

On top of that my account was n't closed. I called back the next day and they still demanded the late fee and balance amount. Also they were saying i did n't close my account. Later on after a long wait on the phone they admitted that last month they closed the account but they left it open. I asked why and got no answer from them. The phone rep just hanged up on me. How rude! So they said they was going to close it again but i still have to pay the late fee. The thing is i was never late and i care about my credit history and Macy 's is saying I 'm late. I have never had this problem with any credit card company just Macy 's, My account was supposed to be closed, they gave me the remaining amount over the phone then they went ahead and charge me a late fee for the month of XXXX and kept my account open. I feel Macy 's credit card should not give out not accurate info. to people, be a little more polite and caring, and stop trying to squeeze out some extra dollars from people. People want to keep a clean payment history and to put it was late when it was not, to me that is wrong. Macy 's should of closed my account and keep the remaining balance owed to them the same and not raising it with late fees.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1684961

Cashnet USA, the Pay Day XXXX loan company I borrowed from, initiated predatory repayment practices immediately. They deliberately schedule automatic debits from my bank account before the end of the month, not even on the last day, with the obvious purpose of forcing customers into collection status. They essentially intercept my XXXX payment now, because my account is charged almost immediately after I receive my XXXX payment. They charge such a high interest rate XXXX 299 % ), in addition to various fees, that my balance only goes up, rather than down, even with regular, large monthly payments. 

My last payment was {$410.00}. They have nearly reached a 100 % profit mark through my repayments. They forced me to borrow more, when I did n't wish to, because they intercepted my XXXX payment one month when I relied on that exclusively. I had no other means of paying for rent and food, and was forced to borrow again. Their system keeps me XXXX and others ) in permanent debt, continually leeching money from bank account. I can not get them to stop, but if they do n't stop adding unfairly large interest, I can never pay off the balance in full, which is the only way to end their abuse of me. 

I would gladly pay the balance, if they would only stop increasing it every month, but I can only do it that if they do stop. It became clear to me that this is exactly the result they intend to create, especially with the fact that they debit the account so early, before most people are paid. I believe I have acted in good faith, and that they have trapped in this system of theirs. Had I realized that they designed this system to be inescapable, I would never have applied. 

I am writing this as a plea for help, for arbitration, to get this predatory company to leave my federally protected XXXX pension alone. My bank is XXXX XXXX XXXX, in Virginia. They are unable to stop Cashnet USA from debiting my account repeatedly, without my signing an affidavit of fraudulent activity, which I am not sure is appropriate, as I entered into the agreement voluntarily ( although misled by Cashnet USA XXXX.",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,1459202
Closing an account,"I have used a Citi credit card for years without problems, paying it automatically in full monthly with my only checking account from XXXX ( credit union ). While logged to my credit card account last summer, I was offered to open a Citi accelerated savings account, which I accepted. I sent money to Citi several times from my checking account in XXXX. Unknown to me, the debit card for this new account was delayed several months. In XXXX one or two Citi cards got to my house, which I share with my son who has the same first and last name, but different middle initial and SSN. My son, who also has a Citi credit card, opened both and called Citi to tell them they were not his. Citi did not attempt to contact me at my phone and email address I reported when I opened the account. Citi listened to a person, my son, whose XXXX does not match the account in question, but blocked my savings account and withdrew the funds, more than {$84000.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX. I learnt this when I got the monthly statement in XXXX. I have called about XXXX times spending about XXXX hours trying to get explanations and have it fixed without success. I have been told the money was returned in XXXX to my checking account, UNTRUE. I was then told it was returned to the checking account on XX/XX/XXXX, UNTRUE. I was told to call different departments in Citi and all of them send me to a different one. I was told to go to the Citi local branch, which does not exist in my entire state. Finally, Citi closed the account and told me they are withholding the money until my XXXX bank sends them legal documents ( a Hold Harmless form ), which XXXX does not want to send because they normally do not do that. So, Citi is preventing me to access my funds despite me having submitted to Citi copies of my passport, utility bill and original from XXXX ( verification of account ownership ). I am now retired and will soon run out of money in XXXX. I do not get SS yet and Citi keeps saying lies and using delay techniques to avoid returning my money to me. 
Citi, without checking XXXX 's, talked about my account to somebody ( my son ) who said this account was not his, instead of taking to the owner, me. With faulty information Citi closed my account as a result. As of now they have not returned my money to me and since my Citi account is now closed, I am not sure I am earning money there. 

Please help to have Citi fix this problem which was created by its employees acting foolishly while listening to somebody who was not the owner of the account Citi promised to keep for me and me only. Even worst is the set of lies and delays Citi is using to avoid returning my money. I simply do not trust Citi anymore. It is a shame how they take advantage of people who are not millionaires.

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"I took out a payday loan with 605 Lending ( FSST Management Services , LLC, d/b/a 605 Lending (  referred hereinafter as 605 Lending, LLC ) ) for the amount of {$500.00} after experiencing an emergency. At the time, I was asked to call to complete the loan process where they say their script on the contract, outlining that the agreement I was to be spent should be signed online to complete the process. All this time, the person who is handling my case is providing me with an overview about the interest minimally -- as in the rates are stated on the agreement that they then asked me to sign and submit while they were on the phone with me. I did not have a chance to go through the exact fine print or terms, but was able to see the percentages at the top and the amount owed. They also said that I was to make payments for the next 12 months bi weekly as per my pay schedule, and I went through and logged each upcoming pay date. They also showed via the page I was provided that the loan would be charging an AYP of what at the time I thought was 440 %. Very expensive but being desperate and pressured I signed and received the funds. Later, I was able to log into the account and reread the loan terms but noticed there was a higher interest rate than I previously saw at over 775.96 % and each payment would be {$150.00}, making the loan well over the originally borrowed {$500.00}. I paid as the terms were outlined though unhappily, especially since no one covered nor is it stated how the principal amount would be payed using my payments. As time moved forward and a few payments were made I had a few issues with early payment processing and subsequent overdrafts on my end and asked the company to switch from ACH debit via writing/ email. They agreed, but sent a LONG email with a gist of "" Remember to follow the terms YOU signed and pay this loan, etc. '' which I understood and said thank you for. In this same email I saw that they were then asking that I send my payment or call in for payment 3 DAYS PRIOR to my original due date and that if i did not I was by proxy allowing for them to sign a check in my name for the amounts owed. I declined and called them asking to make sure they knew not only was this not acceptable but unwelcome. I also said that I would not pay until my due date which is my right as the consumer but was met with the same "" Follow your agreement '' line. I again stated this was not acceptable and again tried to reach out where I was again met with opposition. Upon further reading the agreement, they have a section labeled under the ACH/ Debit section stating that as the signee I "" may not revoke the authorization to prepare and submit drafts on my behalf until such times as the loan is paid in full ''. Under thisclause is then another clause stating another payment option called a "" REMOTELY CREATED CHECK ( RCC ) AUTHORIZATION '' and is outlined as such : "" If you elect to make your payments by remotely created check ( otherwise known as a demand, draft, XXXX, preauthorized draft or paper draft ), then by electronically signing this Payment Authorization Agreement you authorize Lender to create checks bearing your name and other information as may be required under applicable law, rather than your handwritten signature, drawn on your bank account below, and to submit each check for payment to your bank or financial institution ( Remotely Created Check ) in the amount of each payment due, under the payment schedule or otherwise to Lender under this Agreement or any amount on any dates on which you and Lender later agree. 
If a remotely Created Check is returned unpaid by your bank or financial institution, then you authorize Lender to create and submit a Remotely Created Check for any late fees or other amounts accrued pursuant to this Agreement. You agree that your typed name or other designation mandated by applicable law will constitute your authorized signature fully reflecting your intent to authenticate any such Remotely Created Check. If you believe the Lender charged your bank in a manner not contemplated by this Payment Authorization Agreement, then please contact Lender. '' After speaking with my bank the tellers both through the online service and at the physical locations ( separate occasions ) said that an ACH and an echeck are basically the same and by revoking one I revoke the other concurrently. Also, If i do not personally authorize each check it is considered fraudulent. 

At this point I have tried to with no success ask that the lender kindly stop auto drafting from my account but to no success. to date, I have paid {$1200.00} with a remaining balance of {$480.00} -- all of which I am totally unsure as to how I will repay without these drafts.

The reason behind this is we know it 's important if you 're paying in full to have the reported to the credit bureau every month on your cycle.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"American Express sent a new credit card in my name to XXXX California and cancelled the card I possessed in XXXX. My identity theft service and I spent numerous hours with XXXX resources around the world, and all American Express personnel continually refused to give me details about the fraudulent telephone call, and most did not call me back as they said they would. Their response to my original letter did not in any way answer my question or resolve my issue. Specifically, I want to know what that criminal said that caused American Express to send a credit card in my name to an address that was never ever on my account. I also want to understand the policies and procedures for sending credit cards to addresses that are not part of the account, and what the law states. 

I placed my American Express credit card on hold until I received the info that I requested, and I never did. This month, they have billed my account for an annual fee, which I am obviously not paying, I only used the card for 4 months after I got it and until this situation is resolved to my satisfaction, I will keep the card in an inactive state. 

I would like someone to contact me with the information requested so that I may evaluate the security practices and my desire to keep this credit card. I have a right to know the details of that call and am at a loss for why American Express will not provide it to their customer. I have been using corporate American Express cards for may years and this unresolved issue will cause conflicts with corporate customers that I may be employed by in the future.

Payoff process,"The Home Depot offers consumer credit cards which are serviced through Citibank. 
They periodically offer extended payment terms with no interest charges if paid within XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX months depending on the amount of the purchase. The extended terms purchases accrue interest at 25.99 % which is only charged if you fail to pay the balance in full before the extended term expires. 
The problem is the way that they apply payments that are made on the account. The online payment system does not allow the customer to direct which balance that you want your payment to reduce. 
In general, the typical account will have balances from : 1 ) current month purchases ( which have not appeared on a monthly statement ), 2 ) prior period purchases ( which must be paid in full by the payment due date to avoid interest charges ), 3 ) one or more extended terms balances ( which must be paid in full by a specified date to avoid the deferred interest charge ). 
The Citibank system will automatically apply a payment to current month purchases before applying anything to the extended terms purchase balances. Obviously, they try to make sure that you do not get the extended terms purchase paid in full before the expiration so that they can collect the accumulated deferred interest charges. 
As a result, I have stopped making any new purchases on my Home Depot credit card which forces Citibank to apply my payment to the extended terms purchases. However, they are still applying the payment to the extended term purchase with smallest amount of accumulated deferred interest charges hoping that I will fail to get the larger balance paid in full before expiration.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,2214366

Still not seeing the credit I called again in XXXX and was told that they could not find such a program offered by them and I would not be entitled to the credit. I checked online and they are still offering the program and when I checked further they did indeed offer it the summer of 2021.

Opening an account,"I opened an account with BMO Harris Bank on XX/XX/XXXX using promo code XXXX. 
I decided to open this account for two reasons : it offered XXXX monthly maintenance fees, and a {$200.00} bonus payable approximately 120 days from account opening if the terms were met. 
The terms were : Have at least two direct deposits of any combination of a paycheck, pension payment, Social Security payment, or other government benefits payment of {$500.00} or more each electronically deposited into the account from an employer or outside agency within 90 days of opening. 
AND Have at least 10 debit card purchases made with your BMO Harris Bank Debit Mastercard post to your account within 90 days of account opening. 
I met both of these requirements in the first 90 days. 

I waited well past the 120 day mark, which would have been XX/XX/XXXX, to call into customer service to find out why my bonus had not been credited. 
I first emailed, but was told I had to call, so I called and spoke with a XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The call lasted approximately half an hour. XXXX put me on hold several times to speak to their marketing department. 

She explained that my deposits came through XXXX, which caused an issue. Their system was recognizing it as a transfer, not a deposit. I explained to XXXX that I do freelance work and that is how I get paid. My paycheck comes through XXXX, and that is my ONLY option for getting paid. 
Also, when I lived in Alabama several years ago, I opened a checking account with XXXX XXXX and they also offered a bonus at that time. I also did freelance work then and was paid through XXXX. I received their bonus with no problem. 

So XXXX stated she would forward that information on to Marketing and if they needed to verify my earnings, they would contact me. She told me bonuses are credited every Wednesday. Well, I did not receive the bonus last Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, or today, XX/XX/XXXX. No one from customer service has contacted me for additional information. 

I am not calling in again to waste another half hour on the phone and get no answers. 

If BMO is advertising a bonus, they should honor it. I met ALL the qualifications. 
If BMO does not count funds deposited from XXXX as a qualifying deposit, they should mention this in their terms and conditions for the offer.

Closing an account,"Sir/Ma'am, XXXX XXXX Member IDXXXX Account Closer and Termination of Membership I'm writing about a close account with USAA. I contacted the bank on or around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX about fraudulent activity on my credit card accounts. The representative took my complaint and forwarded it to the Fraud Department. someone from the Fraud Department call me the same day or a day later to get an report. I gave my report and the agent went back over what he wrote and there was one statement that I didn't agree what was written. cant remember the exact wording, but it was to the fact that I have given my banking information to someone and I did not make that statement. And he told me that since there was an discrepancy with that particular statement that it would have to be looked into by someone else. He also told me that after the statement was looked at again that USAA could stop my membership along with close all of my banking accounts. I asked how when I didn't have anything to do with it. I'm sure you all will see all of what I'm saying on the report. Long story short I get a call yesterday XXXX XX/XX/XXXX informing me that USAA will no longer do business with me and that all of my accounts will be closed within the 60 days. At this time I ask does that mean I can never get my memberships back again and he said no you will not be able to. I was very frustrated to hear this but I had no other choice but to accept. I used USAA as my primary banking institute. I tried to access my account to bay bills, the most important was my electrical bill that's due XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I have no other money that I have access to. Not only is my electrical bill due and at risk at being cut off, I have child care, I need food to feed my family, gas to get back and forth to work, medication for my wife, water bill is due next week, along with other bills that I have. I am the sole source of income right now my wife has not worked since XX/XX/XXXX due to the pandemic she received unemployment for about six weeks and nothing afterwards. She also was diagnosed with XXXX and XXXX XXXX and she has to have medication to manage the pain along with doctor visits. This really put me and family under finical stress during this terrible time that we are having with the pandemic. I don't understand how a bank could do Americans like this at this during this dark time we are experiencing. to take away someone's money when people are struggling to make mortgage payments, food on their tables, paying their electrical bills all of the necessities required in order to live and try to provide for their families. There should be a Federal Mandate on bans that require them not to close people accounts during a pandemic or at least give them 30 days to get their affairs in order so that they are able to have access to their money and can continue to pay their bills and have food. Again I just don't see how you can do fellow Americans like this. President Biden 's intent is to help all Americans during the pandemic and I'm sure he wouldn't like to hear what banks are doing to their customers instead of helping them you are hurting them. President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan to send Americans up to {$1400.00} to help people like me and my family. My stimulus was scheduled to be deposited into my USAA account, but not it cant because my account is closed. This stimulus would have really helped my family to pay bills relieving some stress from us. not only that my IRS return was scheduled to be deposited into this account that I can't receive. Then I'm told that deposits can come in but nothing can go out. So that means you can hold my much needed money for up to 60 days before you close out my accounts and then send my money. In 60 days I would more than likely be have lost everything that I have my home, cars, credit. Our stimulus and our IRS returns would have really help us from struggling and provided us the opportunity to see some light. This is really wrong to do people like this and I think you need to take a look into your banking rules and be compassionate during this time. 

I would like for you to please un-restrict my account and allow me to at least get money to pay my bills and provide for my family. But again I did not attempt any fraud on any of my accounts and I ask that it be looked at again at the highest level. 

I would like for you to consider expediating my account to do whatever needs to be done so that I can move on and put this behind me. I have always appreciated being a member of USAA and do not like the way our relationship ended although I do know you have rules and regulations. 

Thank you",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,4207763
Dealing with my lender or servicer,"In XXXX, I spoke with a Wells Fargo representative who told me that my loans would not need to be repayed until XXXX unless I graduated before that, in which case I would have a 6-month grace period after my date of graduation.

Dealing with your lender or servicer,"Background of Problem : On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for an XXXX XXXX online and received an email from XXXX that I was denied the card because I was recently past due on a payment. I called XXXX and they told me that the credit servicer that reported that I was past due was XXXX. I then called XXXX and requested a copy of my credit report. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my copy of the credit report and noticed that XXXX XXXX XXXX/Suntrust Bank was the company that was reporting that I was past due on a student loan. The credit report showed that they were reporting a maximum delinquency of 120 days in XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00}. I noticed on the credit report that they had made various inquires to my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( 3 ), and on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to dispute this loan because I have been a victim of credit fraud in the past and I initially thought that this was credit fraud. XXXX opened up an investigation and that it would be completed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my wife received a message from Suntrust Bank XXXX XXXX and my wife forwarded this message to my phone. The message contained her contact information and she mentioned the dispute of the loan. Because the credit report contained the account number we researched online for Suntrust/XXXX  and found the XXXX website. We created an online account and found that there was only three letters in this account online : One showing a disbursement date of XX/XX/XXXX and breakdown of loan, One showing that I may qualify for a rate reduction, and the last letter showing loan was delinquent. These were the only letters in the online account on XX/XX/XXXX and I printed them. I requested loan documentation from XXXX online and didnt receive them till XX/XX/XXXX and the letter was received open. I then returned the phone call to XXXX XXXX at Suntrust and requested proof of loan documentation. I received this documentation on XX/XX/XXXX via email. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I received the loan documentation from XXXX XXXX and noticed that there was a document showing a change of loan declaration with a school separation date of XX/XX/XXXX and that this change was made on XX/XX/XXXX. It appeared that the loan was deferred. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, After receiving the loan information from Suntrust bank, I requested time off from work to investigate this loan with the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. XXXX provided me with copy of the disbursement on XX/XX/XXXX from Suntrust Bank. At this time I remembered that I did indeed have a loan with Suntrust Bank back on XX/XX/XXXX. It had been five years since my graduation in XX/XX/XXXX and I had not received any correspondence from Suntrust/XXXX in all this time. I also had a school loan with XXXX XXXX and they immediately started billing me after graduation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX and let her know that the loan was mine, but I still had concerns. The concerns were the loan deferment and the fact there were late fees and I had never received any letters from Suntrust/XXXX   regarding my loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX responded via email but did not address my concerns regarding the deferment, late fees, and letter issue. I sent another email regarding the fact that she had not addressed my concerns and she responded via email to contact XXXX regarding those questions. I contacted XXXX via email regarding these same concerns and they claimed they had sent letters and a repayment obligation letter and that I could find them online. I logged in to the online account and there were several letters in the online account that were not available when I created the account on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the only letters that were online were the three I mentioned earlier. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX claimed that XXXX notified them on XX/XX/XXXX that I was in School status until XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX and XXXX provided a verification of enrollment showing that the clearinghouse had me enrolled until XX/XX/XXXX and that I had never attended any other term after Spring XXXX. I provided the copy of the letter to XXXX XXXX at Suntrust and also to XXXX via email and never received a response on who deferred the loan. As of this day I had only received a phone call from Suntrust Bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and I have only received one letter dated XX/XX/XXXX. I have never received any correspondence from the post office or phone call from Suntrust/XXXX before XX/XX/XXXX. My address has not changed since I applied for this loan. I updated my telephone number on XX/XX/XXXX when I returned XXXX XXXX phone call because they had my wifes number which she had forwarded the message immediately. So if they had tried contacting me via my wifes telephone she would have forwarded that message and I would have contacted them. Suntrust/XXXX has not explained who deferred the loan and why they reported loan delinquency on my credit when they never contacted me before XX/XX/XXXX. 

Concerns : My Concerns regarding this loan are : 1. Who deferred the loan? 
2. The Credit reporting on my credit report. 
3. Suntrust/XXXX claiming that they have sent letters and tried contacting me before XX/XX/XXXX and the fact I have never received a letter from Suntrust Bank or XXXX before this date. 
4. I do not understand the loan breakdown 5. I am not sure if I am paying Suntrust, XXXX, and recently a loan collector called XXXX that contacted my wifes number regarding this loan.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3426848

They said this is a one time lifetime courtesy. They said 2 billing cycles to apply. Today I call up and I am told that I have to pay. No one informed me and I saw the whole card of what I owe is the extra interest. I asked why. They said the request was rejected to remove the XXXX dollars. So I asked why did they tell me it was a one time occurrence and have me pay XXXX dollars if they were not going to do it? They just refused. I think it is unfair.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"My current loan provider is Ed Financial. I consolidated my federal loans with them in XXXX XXXX. I have been paying my loans back on a graduated repayment schedule since XXXX XXXX. The payments increase every 2 years on this repayment plan. I had been on the year 8 ( payments XXXX ) repayment category when I went out on maternity leave in XXXX XXXX. I did n't make payments for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( after discussing this with my loan provider ). At that point I had "" paid ahead '' and did n't have payments due for 3 months. When I returned to making payments in XXXX XXXX, they returned to listing my graduated repayment "" amount due '' in the year 1-2 ( payments 1-24 ) category. But I am paying at the year 8 category ( payments XXXX ) as I had been. Since I am paying more than what is "" due '' per this reset calculation, they are listing my next payment due date as XXXX XXXX. I have asked that they place me into the appropriate payment tier for repayment, so that my payments will increase every 2 years on a graduated schedule. I was told that my payments will not increase every two years ( unless I remember to change my payment every 2 years ) since I am now considered to be "" paying ahead ''. They told me that they just ca n't increase my monthly payment every 2 years and that this would "" cause more problems and hurt more people that it would help ''. I explained that I wanted them to provide me with an accurate payoff date based on the amount I am currently paying, with an increase every 2 years. I told them that my goal is to pay off my student loans faster. They told me what I am asking them to do is "" hypothetical '' and they do n't understand why I would want them to do this. They offered to give me a monthly payment of around XXXX dollars for the next XXXX payments. I told them that again, my goal was to shorten my repayment term, not lengthen it. And I pointed out that if I only paid XXXX dollars for the next XXXX payments, this would lengthen the repayment, not shorten it. After spending 2 hours on the phone, with XXXX different people at EdFinancial, I was left with being told to find my own amortization schedule online by googling it so see how I could pay my loan off faster and estimate the maturation date of the loan. They also failed to provide me with an accurate maturation date for the loan. They continue to provide me with a maturation date based on the payment tier they are listing me in ( years 0-2 ) instead of where I am currently paying and would be projected to increase every 2 years. I expressed my frustration and concern to EdFinancial and even requested to speak to a supervisor, who was actually the one who told me to look up an amortization schedule online myself. I explained to them that I have another student loan provider who provides me with payoff information in real time based on my current payment.

Fraud or scam,"On XX/XX/2023 my wife and I responded to a XXXX XXXX ad that had a classic truck listed for sale. The seller claimed they were the owner of a car dealership in their area, and my online research to confirm this checked out, there was indeed a dealership by that name, in that area, owned by said man and reviews were promising. Classic trucks are hard to come by, so it's normal to find XXXX outside of your local area, and pay to have it shipped to you. We exchanged numerous emails and phone calls with the seller, received extra pictures and videos of the truck, including pictures of the VIN #, and title. We then negotiated a sales price of {$18000.00} to purchase the truck and an additional {$540.00} to have it shipped to us. We were then emailed a bill of sale and wire intructions and told to wire the payment for the truck, and the shipping charge would be paid for upon arrival. We wired the payment through our bank on XX/XX/2023, the seller confirmed receipt of the wire through email on XX/XX/2023 at XXXX and confirmed at XXXX same day that the driver had already left for delivery, we were to expect him to contact us. After XXXX  days the driver had not yet called us, we emailed the seller who confirmed that the driver was in XXXX, headed towards us and he'd ask the driver to call us. By XXXX still no call from the driver and the seller said he tracked him through GPS and the driver was then in XXXX XXXX NC but was unreachable by phone. At XXXX still no contact with the driver and the seller gave me the driver 's cell phone number and let me know the truck is insured and he believes there's a reasonable explanation for his delay. On XX/XX/2023 at XXXX, I reached out to the seller again who confirmed he still had no contact with the driver and if the truck wasn't delivered on that day, he would refund our money and call the insurance company and law enforcement. At XXXX on XX/XX/2023 the seller gave me the driver 's coordinates, and that's the last time I heard from the seller. On XX/XX/2023 at XXXX I emailed him to say that I've called him multiple times that day and left voicemails with no response, and to please return my call. By XX/XX/2023 he had blocked my calls and we saw the same truck for sale on XXXX XXXX again, same pictures, same description, same price, different seller name but the same phone number. On XX/XX/2023 my emails to the seller were returned as undeliverable, he had now blocked my emails. Upon researching further, I learned that the dealership this seller listed had been out of business for a few years and the seller was impersonating the business and the owner. I filed a police report on XX/XX/2023. The police agree with me that we were robbed through an internet scam. I contacted my bank to see if there was anything that could be done. The bank told me to provide the details above and they would investigate, if it was found to be a fraudulent sale, they would refund our {$18000.00}. Once the investigation was complete they said that while it was fraud, we would have to pursue the matter in civil court. The police agree that that will get us no where. I know that the bank has a policy in place to protect consumers from this type of thing, if their policy is to refund the money upon finding there was fraud, then I should be refunded my money as this is, quite obviously, fraud.

XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX claimed that it was operating on behalf of XX/XX/XXXX. After reaching agents in XXXX and requesting to be transferred to a site in the United States, it became clear that I was speaking with Navient, not XXXX. Navient claimed that it is operating on behalf of XXXX. Since Navient is not a guarantor, it similarly does n't have the right to issue an Administrative Wage Garnishment. I requested that Navient provide debt verification or validation. Navient has not done so. Navient is not the holder of a student loan account, and I have repeatedly informed Navient that I do not owe on student loans. The name provided for me is incorrect, and I have demonstrated what my legal name is. I feel that Navient is engaged in identity theft. Had I had student loans and had Navient fka XXXX served as the loan servicer, Navient would have needed to have provided me with payment stubs, the opportunity for IBR and PSLF, and some form of documentation. My only vocation has been a teacher ; therefore, there is no excuse for Navient 's claim that I have a defaulted loan. I have not signed any loan documents, and I did not receive any loan proceeds to attend college. It is not acceptable for Navient to represent itself as XXXX, and it is not acceptable for XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX to act on behalf of Navient, while claiming that it is acting on behalf of XXXX. I have filled out an FTC Identity Theft Report, and I want Navient held accountable for their illegal and fraudulent practices. People in this country are committing suicide and suffering from extreme poverty due to the actions of these hideous individuals destroying the financial and ethical fabric of America. The most recent fraud against me happened after erroneous information was listed in my credit report, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX accessed my information on XX/XX/2016. Although I am working with the Credit Bureaus to have this information corrected, action needs to be taken against Navient for its involvement in this matter.",,2331052

When I moved a year ago, I changed my address with what I thought was all of my accounts, but I missed Diners Club. Since I was n't using the card regularly, I did n't get statements, and so nothing was forwarded from my old address. Then, Diners Club charged me an annual fee on the account. I never received a statement, or an email ( my email address was current with the company ). I only noticed something was wrong when I checked my credit report, and they were showing me 90 days past due for XXXX {$100.00}. When I called them, I discovered it was because of an annual fee. Despite saying they would fix my credit report, it 's still showing the past due at all three bureaus after three weeks. It 's unconscionable that credit card companies can tarnish your credit report simply because you did n't pay an annual fee -- I can understand closing the account, but to be penalized for years because of an unpaid annual fee is ridiculous.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"IT IS MY ASSERTION, BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTUAL INFORMATION THAT CALIBER HOME LOANS VIOLATED MY RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER, BORROWER AND MORTGAGOR, VIOLATING THE COVENANTS IN GOOD FAITH AND FAIR DEALING, RESULTING IN LOSS OF MY CONTRACT. 

1. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I received a letter from Attorneys representing the original lender stating You are listed as a Borrower, but did not sign the Mortgage. 

2. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX made the attached order to Reform Mortgage to include myself, XXXX XXXX, as Mortgagors and Borrower. This judgement allowed for me to discuss MY mortgage, apply for modification, using my current financial information, receive receive assistance from a HUD approved housing counselor and any/all foreclosure prevention and alternatives. 

3. While XXXX, my services, exhibit bad-faith conduct in failing to properly consider an application for a loan modification, forcing me over the years to submit application after application, never receiving a definitive answer. Ultimately, having to seek the courts intervention to enjoin the mortgage. I was given a figure of {$1700.00} as a mortgage payment via court order on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( see attached court order ). 

4. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX correspondence was received from my servicer, XXXX, stating PMI s insurance is no longer required and there will be no further premiums or fees due. I repeatedly tried to contact XXXX to ask if I deduct this amount from the {$1700.00} and received no response. 

5. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, correspondence was received regarding notice of SALE OF OWNERSHIP OF MORTGAGE LOAN from Caliber Home Loans , INC . The letter statedCALIBER IS THE SERVICER OF YOUR LOAN. The letter instructed that ; IF I MAKE A MONTHLY PAYMENT LESS THAN THE FULL AMOUNT THAT IT CALLED A PARTIAL PAYMENT. PARTIAL PAYMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED AND REQUIRE THE SERVICER TO APPY THEM TO YOUR LOAN. 
My partial payment of {$1400.00} was returned to me, making Calibers  assertion of accepting partial payments and requiring the SERVICER to apply them to the loan FALSE AND MISLEADING. 

6. I continually tried to contact Caliber Home Loans, to rectify the situation immediately. Calibers first response, not addressed to myself, stated that Caliber, is honoring my request to my SERVICER, to cease and desist communications. I never requested this of XXXX and Caliber offered no documents supporting the cease and desist. 

7. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I was finally able to contact a representative via telephone, from Caliber, who said while she unable to discuss my mortgage with me, stating I am not the BORROWER, she was referring me to customerresolutions @ caliberhomeloans regarding Caliber Home Loans, Inc, continued refusal to communicate with me regarding my mortgage and foreclosure alternatives. 

8. 7. Correspondence was received via XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from Caliber, stating a customer has the right to submit a written notice of ERROR to the SERVICER of their Mortgage 9. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, after the foreclosure, correspondence was received from Caliber, acknowledging receipt of my correspondence, and that Caliber would perform the necessary research and respond within the time period required by LAW.?? 
CALIBER FORECLOSED ON MY HOME WITHOUT PERFORMING THE NECESSARY RESEARCH AND RESPONDING AS REQUIRED BY LAW. ANOTHER FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENT. 


Reasonableness should be shaped by identifying the "" purposes of the contract, '' the parties expectations, and "" community standards of honesty, decency, and reasonableness. '' CALIBER simply exercising the discretion to foreclose may be evidence of bad faith, while ignoring the COURT ORDER NAMING ME as both BORROWER AND MORTGAGOR, refusing communication, counseling, prevention and alternatives to foreclosure, resulting in loss on my contract and impending homelessness for myself and my sons.",,2705830

I paid the total purchases of {$49.00} and my minimum payment due of {$120.00}. When I received my XXXX bill due XX/XX/XXXX, there was an interest charge of {$4.00} based on {$230.00} of purchases. I called on XXXX and complained and I was told that it's a computation I'll have to complete each month by taking the new balance less the balance transfer and pay that amount. I actually paid more than that amount so the answer makes no sense. She waived the charge again but I have no way of determining what they are charging or why when the transfer balance should be {$0.00} interest and I am paying my purchases in full plus an additional amount. The customer service is terrible and they never have an actual answer as to why the interest is being charged or how the amounts are calculated.",,2898911

Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,"On XX/XX/17 I made my mortgage payment on line to XXXX. I always make my payments at the end of the month before 12 AM. XXXX assured me that as long as the payment is made within the month it is not considered late.

XXXX reported that I made the payment on XX/XX/17. I immediately called XXXX to address the issue in XX/XX/2017 and the representative looked up the payment information and admitted that the error was made by XXXX and that they would correct my credit report to reflect the actual date that I went on line to make my payment. The representative told me that I should check my creidt report after 30 days and I would see the correction. 

Thirty days later I checked my report and the 30 day late was still there. I called XXXX and inquired about the late payment and told the representative that I spoke to another rep. who assured me that the inaccurate information would be removed. She was very nasty to me and said they can not remove the information because the payment posted on XX/XX/17 and there was nothing I could do and that I should have received a letter in the mail. I insisted that I spoke to another Rep who told me something totally different. Then she tells me my payment was made after 9 PM and that why it posted the next day. However, I told her to check my history to see that I make all my payments the last day of the month just before midnight and I always get credit for that same day not the post date. She asked me "" What if I check your payment history and we decide to go back and change all your payments to late ''? She was really rude! After we kept going back and forth she told me that the credit bureau would not allow XXXX to change the late payment. She kept giving me different excuses. 

I am very particular about making my payments on time.

Can't repay my loan,"Navient began harassing me for payment on my student loans XX/XX/XXXX after I attended XXXX University. I was unemployed without a degree, as struggles during the Recession prevented me from finishing school. I paid as much as I could, and on multiple occasions they took money from my bank account without permission.

I neglected basic needs, including rent and medical procedures, for years to keep Navient from enacting the consequences they consistently threatened. They called me XXXX times a day, but failed to provide any helpful information to improve my situation. 

When I was finally able to finish school through other forms of aid, Navient refused to fill out important paperwork and it nearly cost me my degree, but miraculous circumstances allowed me to finish despite their interference. I was then able to find full time work, but still depended on welfare. Consistent income allowed me to enter into a payment plan with Navient, but after a year I noticed my balance was the same. Navient refused to explain this discrepancy, send statements or take my low income into account. They also adjusted my balance history several times without notifying me. 

This prompted me to take action, and I spent months researching my history with Navient and creating spreadsheets to calculate what they had done to me. I discovered that what they were reporting to the IRS was inaccurate, they had failed to disclose vital terms of programs I had entered, and other despicable practices specifically designed to perpetually keep me in debt. I had borrowed {$33000.00} and paid off over {$10000.00} but my debt had still grown to {$48000.00} in a just a few years. It was at this time that Navient raised my payment from {$330.00} a month ( XXXX my income XXXX to nearly {$600.00} without explanation. 

In analyzing my circumstances, I discovered that my life was never going to be stable if I continued to make increasing payments to Navient, but I had a decent shot if I reduced my payments began to save and take care of myself. I notified Navient that I would be paying them {$90.00} a month until my circumstances improved, and they continued to raise the payment and attack my credit score, dropping it over XXXX points in just a few months. They also adjust my delinquency time and amount to whatever benefits them the most, but deny this when confronted. I 've documented every single phone call, and they consistently refuse to help me. I 've been told on multiple occasions to stop calling because I am a waste of their time.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I have an on going problem with PayPal Credit. The issue is that PayPal Credit improperly credits payments to my account in an attempt to prevent me from paying off special financing purchases they offered not to occur accrued finance charges for that promotional offer This is not a mistake but a deliberate attempt and practice of PayPal Credit to collect finance charges on those promotional purchases they are not owed. In other words, they assess finance charges when the promotional balance would have been paid off by the excess payment amounts I made during the billing period in excess of the minimum payment for that billing period for promotional finance offers where the balance would of been easily paid off with my excess monthly payments making it impossible to pay off the promotional offer without paying any finance charges like they advertise.. Instead of properly crediting the oldest, expiring offer they ALWAYS credit the newest offer that does not expire for months! I have experienced this numerous times over the past two years with PayPal credit. They always have an excuse as well. One time I call they say the excess payment must be included with my minimum payment. The next time they state it must be made in two or more separate payments. .I 've spent hours of the phone with them and they always say they will corrected and they will send it to research to have the payment reallocated... Well in the few instances where it was reallocated it happed they "" conveniently '' make the payment adjustment the next day AFTER they have assessed finance charges on the entre promotional period. I've neve dealt with a bank where customer service agents have to send every account adjustment off to another department and take 3-4 weeks for for the actual adjustment to be made and even then they still assess the finance charges for their '' mistake ''.

Attempts to collect debt not owed,"Phoenix Financial Services ( hereafter referenced as "" Phoenix '' ) is continuing to harass me with an invalid collection bill, months after it was paid in full. I would like them to cease contacting me or my family, with the exception of a written statement showing that the bill has been paid. 
In XX/XX/2018, Phoenix phoned my wife and me several times about a collection bill for {$430.00} for medical services from creditors XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We explained that we needed to investigate, because we believed that the original creditors had already been paid. Nonetheless, Phoenix threatened to report the debt to credit agencies unless we paid them, and offered a "" discounted '' amount to resolve the issue. I declined, and explained again that if the debt was valid, I would pay, but that we needed to investigate the validity of the debt before paying. 
On XXXX XX/XX/2018 @ XXXX XXXX XXXX, because of my concern about a negative mark on my credit report, I paid Phoenix the full amount through their online system at phoenixfinancialsvcs.com. I continued to investigate the original alleged debt, but business travel in XXXX 2018 hampered my progress working with the original creditors. I have confirmed via my bank ( and bank statement ) that Phoenix received payment from me on XXXX XX/XX/2018, in the amount of {$430.00}. 
I then received another letter from Phoenix, dated XXXX XX/XX/2018 more than a month after I paid their bill again requesting payment of {$430.00} for a debt that remains outstanding, and offering a discount offer of {$280.00}. 
I called Phoenix on XXXX XX/XX/2018 @ XXXX am to ask why they sent me a letter when the bill had been paid months earlier. The Phoenix staff member indicated that it could be a mistake, but she couldnt see any record of payment on her side. She asked me to email or fax her my bank statement, which I declined to do for privacy reasons. She transferred the call to who XXXX, XXXX ( sp? ). 
During my conversation with XXXX, I asked her who at Phoenix could look up the record of transactions to find the payment, since she stated that she could not. She answered no one. I expressed disbelief. I ended the call, and called back minutes later to state on the record that I would transition to written communication only to address this issue going forward. I am concerned that these aggressive tactics may be a common business practice of Phoenix, to get people to pay invalid debts multiple times. 
I request that Phoenix consult their financial systems to verify receipt of payment of {$430.00} from me in XX/XX/2018. I would like them to send me written acknowledgement of the payment, confirming that there is no outstanding bill. After that, I would like them to cease contacting me or anyone in my family neither by phone nor by letter regarding this issue.

Delinquent account,I received several calls over the course of 3 days from the same phone #. The caller never left a message and called excessively each day until I finally answered on the third day. He said he was calling from Wells Fargo about my unpaid balance of {$30.00}. I asked him why I never received a statement he said he could not control the Post Office. So when I saw he was being sarcastic I told him I would check my account online and ended the call. My problem is this is the first time I remember getting a call from Wells Fargo about my payment being past due. I have had this account for more than 3years and have kept up with the payments. I do n't understand the need for calling me at least three times daily about a balance of {$30.00}. I do know a thing or two about collections. He should have left a message the first or second time so I would know what the call was about. Then he would not have had to call me a third time. I would have just answered.

"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account","I have lived in XXXX XXXX for 50 years, my lifelong desire was to retire here and have my home to retire in. My husband and I purchased our home in XX/XX/XXXX, we worked hard and were able to make all the mortgage payment in 30 years, and after much sacrifice our home was finally free and clear. Now we face the distinct possibility of losing our home to foreclosure and may end up on the streets. I work hard and am a good citizen that has fallen on hard times. 
My loan servicer, M & I, closed the door on communication years ago when I tried to get assistance on my mortgage. I was completely shut down by their representatives who had no compassion for my circumstances. I am now in a situation where I am holding on to my home by a thread, when all it would have taken was a little bit of effort on the part of M & I to provide me access to available assistance programs for homeowners. It has been a very difficult time for me as I struggled to get back on my feet financially and attempt to same my home.My husband passed away in XX/XX/XXXX. My life took a XXXX degree turn for the worst as my life time partner, my friend was gone for good and left me facing all of the family affairs. Soon the bills started piling up, my husband 's creditors started harassing me for payments. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced to refinance my home to help cancel my husband 's debt and for home improvements. We installed a new roof, repaired the central air conditioner, and other improvements. I did not realize I signed up for an interest only payment. I reached out to M & I for assistance, but was immediately shut down. I fell behind on my payments and I tried to negotiate some type of agreement. I fell further and further behind. I had every door closed on me as I tried to have a loan modification case opened.I can not see where it is ethical or fair to block me from applying for assistance. They were so eager to sign me up and refinance my property. 
They are required by the government to review my loan for options and my loan should have been review over the past few years for retention options. I only spoke with one person at M & I but refused to work with me on my loan. I feel that I need my issue elevated to an executive level. I have n't been able to speak with above the line staff level and I was hoping your office could intervene and get me someone who could take my matter seriously and speak on my level. I should have never had to go through the difficulties they put me through and it looks like they got about XXXX to help homeowners. It appears that my loan qualified for government modification programs when I reached out to them in the past. 
Now they are trying to take my home away through foreclosure. It 's their fault that I am so far down the road and behind on my payments because they should have helped me years ago. They do n't understand their improper communication made a bad situation worse. My income is steady and I want to keep my home. I am hoping your office could contact them on my behalf to open the door to a meaningful discussion to save my home and get my loan on proper footing.

Getting a credit card,"Hi, I applied for Capital One Venture X credit card by mid-XX/XX/2023 and I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX to upload my documents by validating my login using my SSN, when I tried logging in with my my SSN it didn't successfully validate it and I tried reaching their Customer service phone even during which my SSN validation was unsuccessful after several minutes a rep answered my phone and told me to mail the documents ( Passport copy and DL copy ) to a po box , which I did by spending almost {$20.00} for mailing cost. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a confirmation email from Capital One that the document were received and they are processing it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One customer service ( with unsuccessful try with my SSN validation over the phone ) and was able to connect with a rep to get a status that they received my documents but no processing has happened at the back-end, which she was going to escalate. 

After two weeks on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One Venture X credit card customer service to check the status ( again with unsuccessful try with my SSN validation over the phone ) and after 40 mins of wait time a supervisor told me that my documents were not clear for processing, i should mail them again for processing, which really frustrated me for two reasons ; 1. Capital One did not notify me that my documents were not legible and I had to call them. 

2. I'm sure, I sent clear documents and why would they not process it. 

I told them, I can not spend another {$20.00} for mail of documents which am afraid they would again say it wasn't clear and I don't have any option to send fax so I requested that whether I could drop my documents at one of their branches, to which the supervisor said they don't process the documents in a Branch. 

This was quite wiered response and I felt that Capital One is doing a scam on Credit card application processing with consumers and they are also making the consumers liable with unnecessary credit check hit on SSN ( which they've already did on my SSN back in XX/XX/2023 ). 

Attached email confirmation from Capital One on my document upload has my application number. 

Pls contact me for further details and kindly take necessary steps to resolve this issue and save consumers from these kind of scams from Capital One credit card.

"Managing, opening, or closing your mobile wallet account","Dear Customer Support Team, I am writing to you today to submit a formal complaint regarding the permanent limitation that has been placed on my PayPal account. I strongly believe that this decision was made in error and I would like to appeal the limitation placed on my account. 

Firstly, I want to clarify that I have not violated any of PayPal 's policies. I have always followed the guidelines provided by PayPal and have never engaged in any activities that would violate your policies. Therefore, I believe that the limitation placed on my account was unjustified. 

Furthermore, I would like to request that PayPal re-investigate my case and restore my account if possible. I am confident that a thorough review of my account will confirm that there has been a mistake and that my account has been wrongfully limited. 

I would like to assure you that I take PayPal 's policies and guidelines very seriously, and I am willing to provide any necessary information or documentation to support my claim that I have not violated any policies. I would also like to request that you provide me with more information about the reason for the limitation, so that I can better understand what has led to this situation. 

Lastly, I would like to confirm that the email address associated with my PayPal account is XXXX. 

I hope that you will consider my appeal and take appropriate action to resolve this matter as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your time and attention. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX",,6885282
Opening an account,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I received a suspicious phishing email with Capitol One font claiming the bank intended to close newly opened savings account. The next day, I called customer service and encountered a nightmare. A customer service person in the Fraud Department who identified himself as XXXX accused me of identity theft and fraudently opening an account. I immediately stated he had no right to make such a claim because Capital One had already verified my valid Washington State driving licence and social security number in addition to confirming that I already had a valid account from XXXX. XXXX proceeded to provide misleading and contradictory information about security protocol even after he had verified my personal information. The entire conversation devolved into a power struggle where XXXX continuously badgered me because he did not believe me and he refused to accept valid state and federally issued documents. Moreover, he did not provide any answers when queried about Capitol One 's demands for constant verification on new accounts and why did Capitol One threaten to close an account after I had verified all the requisite information. To add insult to injury none of the Capitol One customer service provided any detailed information to explain why the financial institution made the decision to flag my account and later accuse me of fraud. 
I will vigorously pursue all legal options to preserve my integrity and ensure that Capitol One immediately discontinues slandering my reputation with false accusations of fraud. Furthermore, since this issue has elements of a XXXX dynamic, I will enlist support of civil rights agencies to safeguard my rights and reputation.",,7079661

Attempts to collect debt not owed,"I stopped using this credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. I had construction crew members in and out of my home from XXXX XXXX XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. During this time my credit card went missing and I thought I had simply misplaced it. In addition to no longer using this credit card I was also longer using Wells Fargo for my daily banking or expenses. In XX/XX/XXXX I called in because I was unable to log into my account at Wells Fargo and was told my account had been closed and credit card charged off for lack of payment. I asked for an explanation because I had not used my account of card for over 4 months. I was told that the representative could not assist me because the account was closed. I was transferred to the fraud department where I explained I had not made any charges on my account since XX/XX/XXXX and I was informed that a fraud claim was submitted on my behalf and it would be taken care of. By XX/XX/XXXX I had seem no change and I called in again and was transferred 4 times due to the fact that no one could help because the account was closed. Since then I have called in several times throughout the next year of XXXX and no progress was made. Eventually a gentlemen told me that in order to have this fraud claim submitted properly at the time I would need to identify each fraudulent transaction on paper on the monthly reports during the time of the fraudulent activity. I was sent these monthly reports by this representative via mail as I did not have access to them personally. I highlighted and marked in pen all of the fraudulent activity ( which was every transaction made on the card in XXXX except for two reoccurring payment which I had not cancelled, XXXX and XXXX ). After two months of waiting to hear back I called for an update and was told that all of the reports that I had sent it were not received. I repeated the task again, and resent the reports marked in black pen and highlighted along with a detailed cover letter reiterating what was marked on the reports ( which addressed the fraudulent charges and the specific charges that were my own ). After another month of waiting I called in for an update again and was told the reports had been received but were thrown away because they could not see that anything was highlighted. They denied the presence of the cover letter or the fact that the reports were also marked in black pen ink as well.

Trouble using your card,"I have been a customer of Capital One for 4 years. I have never been late, I have never been over the credit limit. Most of my payments were in full. This summer I would like to purchase a used vehicle in cash, so I decided to pay less on my credit cards and keep more cash. 
On XX/XX/2023, all 3 of my accounts were restricted without warning. They claim that the "" fraud department '' needs me to submit 3 recent bank statements to confirm my identity. 
This does not make sense, and there is no reason to do so. Is this because I'm not paying my balance in full anymore? Is this because it took several tries for me to obtain a cash advance since customer service kept giving poor instructions on how to do so each time I called? When I called the "" fraud department '' on XX/XX/2023, the rep was very evasive. 
Since I didn't receive any response to my letter, I called the "" fraud department '' to follow up today XX/XX/2023. I spoke with the 1st rep who acknowledged the letter, and then was transferred to her manager who claimed that she didn't see any letters. Then this same manager hung up on me! She informed me that I was be recorded, ( which is perfectly fine and expected ), and I told her I was recording her as well. She stated I couldn't record her and hung up on me. I would like for the recording of this conversation to be part of this investigation.

Struggling to repay your loan,"When I took out this Parent Plus Loan in 2007 with Sallie Mae the amount was {$33000.00}. The interest rate was 8.500 %.

I was not aware that the interest would keep accruing even though the payments had been postponed for a few months. Navient is now the carrier of this loan.

I called Navient several times to discuss this outrages amount of this loan and I was told that because this is a Parent Plus Loan that there is nothing they can do for me.

The plumbing manager was trying to force me to take a tank water heater when I paid for tankless. I feel like my rights as a homeowner were being trampled on. Is he paying for the job or am I? He has no right to force me to take something. For two to three hours, I had no idea what was going on. At one point I asked for my existing tank to be put back and just cancel the job to the worker and plumbing manager. But my old tank AFTER removal did not work was what I was told.

Struggling to pay mortgage,"For many years Ive suspected that my loan balance has been misrepresented by Ocwen Loan Servicing ( OLS ) based on payments that Ive made for the life of the loan. I admit that I have run into financial difficulties for more than a 1 years, and was unable to pay my mortgage due to an unexpected separation between myself and my wife. 
Once things began to finally stabilize financially for me and I was able to secure a solid employment and regular earnings. I began to review old OLS, accounting records for my loan. It was at that point that I realized that my account summary carried vary flagrant discrepancies within the charges themselves. They illustrated duplicate charges in some cases within the same day, for the same service and appear to be compounded in comparison to whats perceived as normal industry standards associated with foreclosure. 
Even at first glance the account summary identifies significant over charging and overall egregious fees and costs associated with foreclosure expenses which are passed on to me and my family to pay. The account is riddled with unwarranted inspection fees and property valuation expense as well as countless foreclosure junk fees. 
It is a known fact, as illustrated in the most recent Class action lawsuit filed by the Consumer financial protection Bureau ( CFPB ) in XX/XX/XXXX that OLS has made thousands of accounting errors on thousands of consumer accounts for many years. On XX/XX/XXXX my loan was loaded into the systems of OLS and Im certain that accounting errors were made on my account. 
OLS, loaded inaccurate and incomplete information into XXXX ( XXXX ) and serviced loans using this information. OLS, relies on an inferior accounting system known as XXXX, this accounting system is dependent upon ensuring the loan data it is using to service loans is complete and accurate, OLS, seeks to complete this loan verification process within 60 days of boarding the loan onto XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX, however OLS, has not completed this process within 60 days. Instead, it has relied on unverified loan information for months and often for more than a year to service hundreds of thousands of loans. Due to this backlog, OLS also delayed verifying the 1.7 million XXXX XXXX loans it previously acquired in XX/XX/XXXX, and which it moved from XXXX XXXX servicing platform and boarded onto XXXX, on a rolling basis beginning in early XX/XX/XXXX. OLS, did not even begin the verification process for the XXXX XXXX loans until XX/XX/XXXX ; at that time, OLS, was servicing more than 1. Million unverified loans. Violations to Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ) As of XX/XX/XXXX, in addition to boarding loans with inaccurate loan information, OLS also boarded loans that contained payment history data that it had reason to believe was inaccurate or incomplete. OLS, for example, boarded incomplete or incorrect payment histories onto XX/XX/XXXX, such as payment histories that include misapplied payments and transactions that occurred before the loan was even originated. 
I have requested on multiple occasions for OLS, to accurately explain the inconsistences in my loan fees and payment application history for the life of the loan, to no avail, which are violations of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) OLS, is now attempting to foreclose on my home without explaining any accounting request that have been requested on my behalf over the years leading up to the foreclosure actions. 
OLS, is also refusing to review my loan for modification assistance although I have the means financially to afford my mortgage. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered a predatory loan modification which also contained a large balloon payment in the amount of {$120000.00}, I struggled with these payments because they were not affordable, and I accepted that loan modification out of desperation to keep my home and avoid displacement of my family. I had no idea that I was able to dispute the offer, when in fact I had 30 days from the approval date to dispute the terms. Tis was never explained by my single point of contact ( SPOC ) at the time. 
Exhibit A XX/XX/XXXX, letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, foreclosure attorney OLS, is also XX/XX/XXXX, my loan was referred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,  foreclosure attorney during the time that I was allegedly being reviewed for a loan modification, which is dual tracking violations to Federal Law effective XX/XX/XXXX. It is written that from the date of the active review all sale activity be placed on hold until the conclusion of the review. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, allegedly OLS mailed me letter of denial that I never received, which subsequently 10 days afterwards a loan modification was granted, unbeknownst to me. I was informed by my XXXX  that a package was lying behind bushes near an unused entrance to my home sometime in late XX/XX/XXXX. In fact, this package was not legible in even the smallest degree. I immediately contacted OLS, and advised them of the occurrence and discovery of the loan modification documents. OLS, recent the documents to me and by the time that I received the documents I was unable to have my attorney review them before OLS, deadline for the documents. Ultimately my loan modification offer was then cancelled. It is also a fact that the 20 year amortization schedule outlined within the XX/XX/XXXX, offer do not calculate correctly. The first page of the offer states principle and interest payments of {$800.00}, based on a rate of 4.725 % and an interest bearing amount of {$170000.00}. If calculated correctly, the payment would actually be {$1100.00}, which means the offer is invalid as it is written. 
OLS, has never maintained a transparent review process with relation to my amount payment application history nor have they remained in compliance with the integrity terms conditions and ongoing industry standard metrics enforced under the National Mortgage Settlement NMS, of XX/XX/XXXX CFPB vs. OLS. Furthermore, we compel OLS, to correct these acts of treachery and abuse prior to our filing a potential civil lawsuit surrounding these arguments set forth and within this complaint.",,2817759

Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,"I had my payments on my loan set up to come out automatically bi-weekly. I called around XX/XX/2020 to get my payoff amount ( to pay the loan in full ) for XX/XX/2020. The CSR that I spoke with on the phone told me that my payoff amount for XX/XX/2020 would be {$220.00}. I asked if the payment that is coming out XX/XX/2020 could be changed to the payoff amount of {$220.00}. The CSR said yes, that she could help me with that. She told me that she changed my payment for XX/XX/2020 to {$220.00} the amount to pay off the loan. The CSR asked if I had any other questions or needed help with anything else before she hung up with me. I said yes that I wanted to verify again that the payment of {$220.00} on XXXX XXXX would payoff my loan in full and leave me with a XXXX balance. The CSR said yes that would pay my loan off in full and I would have a XXXX balance. My payment of {$220.00} went through my bank on XX/XX/2020 paying my loan off in full with them. 

I got a message on XXXX on XX/XX/2020 saying that I owed them money. I at first thought it was a scam but later realized it was from American Cash- the loan I paid off the end of XXXX. I let them know that I did not owe them anything because I paid them off XX/XX/2020 per my conversation with the CSR that I had around XX/XX/2020 and that as far as I am concerned the account was paid in full. 

I got a message back XX/XX/2020 telling me that my payment for XX/XX/2020 was returned. That is not correct because I had no payment per my bank that was returned XX/XX/2020. Besides I have overdraft protection on my account so the bank would have covered the payment and charged me an nsf fee for the overdraft. I had my payments set up as automatic withdrawal on my paydays. I did not cancel the automatic withdrawal or put a stop payment on it. The automatic withdrawal was in place until I paid the loan in full. 

The message went on to say that I agreed to make 20 payments and I did not make the last two. The last two were not made because I paid my loan off in full on XX/XX/2020. It is against the law in Wisconsin to charge a person for early payoff of their loan. I don't understand how I can be charged for paying my loan off early. When I called for my payoff on XX/XX/2020 or matter of fact when anyone calls for a payoff, that payoff includes any principle, interest, nsf fees, and/or late fees that incurred up to the date of the payoff so it pays the account in full.When I called around XX/XX/2020 for my payoff on XX/XX/2020 all of that should have been included in the payoff. 

I also received an email dated XX/XX/2020 stating they were charging me an nsf fee for a returned payment. Again, none of my payments to this company was returned by my bank ever! How can they charge me for something that did not happen? Very unethical practices with this company. Also if there was an nsf or missed payment, why wait over a month to contact me? I know the company I work for doing loans, we contact the person as soon as a payment is returned or payment is missed if the payment has not been set up already. 

Again in summary, I was told by a representative of their company that on XX/XX/2020 when my payment of {$220.00} posts that the account with them was paid in full.",,3833588
Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,"On XX/XX/2018, my application for discharge of my federal student loan was approved on the basis of my total and XXXX  XXXX, and canceled my obligation to repay the remaining balance. Please see attached letter. The letter states that a total of {$300000.00} was discharged. 

Following my receipt of this letter XXXX XXXX and Equifax reported that the loan was closed and reflected a XXXX balance. This raised my credit score to over 800 and "" Exceptional. '' XXXX   continued to reflect the balance was over {$330000.00}. I filled two disputes with XXXX. Both times the results came back with a higher balance and lowered my credit score by more than 30 points. When I called XXXX  they said I needed to deal with the lender ( XXXX XXXX ) directly.

I instantly knew I needed to look further into this charge. Since I obviously am not physically in Georgia, nor have I ever bin there. I contacted the Fraud Department at Bank of America and was advised they will send a new card and to destroy the current one my husband has. We listened to the representative and waited for a response from the Claim Resolution Team regarding the fraud transaction. The bank never contacted us until XX/XX/2019 via US mail letter stated that the transaction in question was authorized and posted correctly to our account and in result we will be charged the funds on XX/XX/2019. 

Today XX/XX/2019 I contacted the number in the letter to ask what append and if they got more information on the suspects. First representative I spoke to just gave me the same information in the letter and just kept repeating himself. So I asked to speak to a manager since he can't do anything further for us. I spoke to a manager rep in the claims department and was advised no investigation was done since the way the transaction was charged [ via chip using my PIN ] it seamed like it would be impossible it was us and that is their decision. I was advised to contact the police department and there is nothing they can do. I tried to get information of the store that processed the transaction but was advised by the rep they don't have that information nor did they try reaching out to the merchant to obtain that information. 

I feel as if this bank is not making correct discussions regarding fraud claims. They didn't even try to investigate so they can protect my hard earned money.

Problem when making payments,"I opened a personal loan with Mariner Finance in XX/XX/XXXX. All aspects of obtaining the loan were done online. 

Mariner Finance recently upgraded their website, I went in to login to my account to make my payment ( which was about 2 weeks late at the time ), and was asked to answer my security questions, something I never had to do with the previous website. Since these were setup almost 4 months ago, I incorrectly entered them.Mariner Finance then proceeded to lock my account with no warning and told me I needed to contact my branch. I understand the need for security, but this is ridiculous. 

Seeing as how my work schedule prevents me from contacting my branch during their operating hours, and their online support which operates on the same schedule ( also crazy ), I reached out via email on XX/XX/XXXX to see if there was any way I was able to verify my identity and unlock my account another way, to which I was told no. 

I count on my online account to make payments, as making payments over the phone is not possible as mentioned above. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment from my bank account using XXXX XXXX, I asked my fiance to call the following day to make sure they received it. He was told they had not, and that it was probably mailed and not transferred electronically ( as of XXXX the payment is listed as processed by my bank, electronically, to Mariner Finance ). He also asked if there was any other way for me to verify my account, or if there was a customer service line open after XXXX PM, to which he was also told no. 

I dont understand how a major loan company has no other avenue to verify my identity other than to call during a limited time frame. And how they would lock an account after incorrectly answering questions ONE TIME. I would be more than willing to submit identity documents, ssn, utility bill, etc,. It should also be noted that when obtaining the loan, I didnt speak to a single person to verify my identity. 

I would like Mariner Finance to unlock my online account so I can continue to make payments. I will submit any identity documentation needed, but I shouldnt have to jump through hoops to make a payment, especially when none of this was needed when taking out the loan in the first place.",,5938961

Fraud or scam,"I was contacted by a team of scammers that over the span of 9 days for hours a day convinced me my accounts were compromised and I needed to wire money to a secure encrypted account through the US Embassy in XXXX XXXX. I have already filed police reports and an IC3.gov. I have also filed a police report in XXXX XXXX. I have been advised the money is gone. My real issue is with the bank, Regions Bank that i feel did nothing to protect me against elder abuse. 

On XX/XX/, I went into the XXXX XXXX location, spoke with management, XXXX and asked for a wire to XXXX of all places in the amount of {$48000.00}. XXXX did ask what the wire was for and the reason for it. On the wire itself it appears to be stamped helping a family friend. I know no one in XXXX let alone XXXX and I was coached for hours to say these things. I have banked with Regions since moving to Texas and has never withdrew amounts like that. And although I am the only person listed on the account on XX/XX/ it is my belief Regions had not only a fiduciary, ethical, but above all else a moral responsibility to represent the interest of their customer, me. It is my opinion that boxes were checked and Regions moved on. They did the bare minimum and wrote it off. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  I entered the XXXX XXXX and wired another another {$140000.00} to XXXX. There is a pattern developing. A customer who has banked with Regions is now wiring large sums of money one would say clearing her account and it happens again after a basic set of pre prompted questions are raised with little to no depth in the responses. This wire was stamped with business start up. There are now two different responses in the span of 3 days, that should be a red flag to someone. I am not sure how many customers Regions has that takes the bulk of their account, wires it to XXXX for a business start up at XXXX  years of age? This shouldnt be a red flag this should be I need to step in. By the time the XXXX is observed its too late. Further the amounts are increased well over double. 

On XX/XX/, I entered the XXXX branch and attempted to wire {$240000.00}. The manager fearing a scam asked for documentation which I didnt have. I left and returned to the XXXX XXXX location and withdrew {$240000.00}. XXXX asked whatever questions he asked and the wire was sent. I know XXXX asked questions. I learned of this on Saturday XX/XX/ and took immediate action. But the manager at the XXXX location did nothing to alert other branches which Im under the impression is their policy. My son also has this recorded with the bank. 

I spent the morning with my son at the branch with XXXX on XX/XX/. My son simply asked what steps Regions was going to take to make this right. The response I received was in part I did my job at the end of the day the money is yours. I stated the banking community needs to do something on a national level to which XXXX agreed. I dont hold XXXX solely liable I hold Regions liable because obviously this happened at two branches. XXXX told me how well coached I was and that he teaches classes on this subject. Full disclosure this conversation was recorded for record keeping purposes. I dont know how a XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  when she doesnt get that cup of morning coffee became a deceptive, lying telling lady capable of deceiving XXXX grown men one of which had a former career in corrections. 

This is not an attack on XXXX, nor the manager at the XXXX XXXX. But this is notification that it is my belief that Regions failed their customer on three separate occasions. I was victimized, picked at random and her banking institution asked a few standard questions and off the life savings went. If we only check boxes how can we ever expect to get better, learn, grow. Asking standardized questions result in standardized results. I believe if we subpoenaed footage from the three wires we would see very little to protect my interests.

Even as I vocally hesitated that I was not sure that I even wanted to purchase anything from them and thus was uncomfortable providing my social security number, the sales representatives assured me that the credit check would not bind me to anything and it was primarily used to see a spending limit as I shop for diamonds. All of this took place before the jeweler brought out any potential diamonds to look at, so it felt as though this was a prerequisite to begin actually shopping at this store. I proceeded to enter my information, and they quickly ran a check and alerted me to how much financing I was qualified for. Eventually, I did not end up purchasing anything from XXXX at all.

My concern is that no one can do the figuring on their own credit card according to what I was told. Also, if someone wants to pay off their account in full, it should be stated on the statement to "" Call for an actual payoff amount ''. I have not had a problem paying off any other of my credit cards and then to see a continuing running balance because of something that is not stated on my statement.

If I had not asked about the payoff amount, my next statement would have had another amount on it that I would not have known amount which could have resulted in an unpaid credit card ( if I had not checked ) and they would have reported me to the credit bureau.

Lost or stolen money order,"My elderly batchelor uncle, died in California in XX/XX/2020. He had no living heirs, beside myself and my three sisters who all live out of state and were not contacted about his death until the XXXX XXXX XXXX called us in XX/XX/2020. 

By the time we learned of the death, individuals unknown to us, had cleared out his condo ( where he had lived for XXXX years ), and were in the process of clearing out his approximately {$200000.00} of bank accounts- with the assistance of his two banking institutions. At the time of his death, ALL of his money was in his PERSONAL NAME. He had {$0.00} in any account titled as a Trust Account, and funded no trusts. Irregardless, CitiBank turned over more than {$170000.00} to an individual who claimed to be his "" Sucessor Trustee '', and converted personal funds into Trust funds... POST DEATH. By doing so, CitiBank employees violated its own internal bank policies, and California Trust law. The individual to whom CitiBanks gave his money, had no right to his Estate Assets, without approval of the California Probate Court. 

In our subsequent lawsuit against this individual, through discovery we were provided a copy of a {$20000.00} CitiBank Official Check our uncle had purchased in XXXX,XX/XX/2020 That check is still outstanding - as the interloper/ '' crook '', has not able to negotiate it. Only his true Estate Executor can do so. 

Using the same CitiBank "" Small Estates Affidavit '' that Citi let the interloper use to drain all the bank accounts- I have sent three written requests to Citi to both be named legal successor, and to gain access to this {$20000.00} check. I believe there may be other funds of our late uncle also 'stored ' in Official/Cashier checks. This was his long-time practice.

Fees or interest,"I signed up for ebills for my Lowes Synchony Bank Credit card in XXXX of this year. I understood the arrangement to be that they would bill me electronically and my linked bank account would arrange and pay for the bill on a monthly basis. I understood the arrangement to include them to bill me the full amount on the monthly bill. Instead they billed the minimum. Therefore they have been charging me interest every month since then - a total of around {$300.00} at a whopping 27 %!. I should have caught this long before now and I attempted to offer a negotiation of {$150.00} as I believe their practice to be dishonest, misleading, deceitful and predatory. What is advertised as a service to simplify your life seems to really only be a ploy to charge interest. 
Upon discovering the issue last week I immediately paid off the principal and 50 % of the interest and this payment has cleared my bank. They did not accept my offer of a negotiation and therefore I'm filing this complaint formally. If they can prove that they informed me that the ebill would only be the minimum due I'll pay the entire interest amount. I would have never signed up for this deal had I understood the "" deal '' as it turned out. I have excellent credit. This is about the principle of clear communication and honesty from the bank.

I have been a loyal and pay in full customer for over 29 years or more. I find it hard to believe that this company has no way of empowering their managers to do anything now that XXXX is over XXXX and was promised a late fee credit previously and since it was due to their lack of setting up the auto pay when it was sent in the mail to them in XXXX XXXX. I do not like getting late fees, nor have I for many years.

Late fee,"We purchased a new Sleep Number bed in XXXX 2013. The financing terms were 0 % interest for 3 years and the credit was issued through GE Capital Retail Bank. Having not received a bill by XX/XX/XXXX the following Spring, we called GECRB to see where things were. We were then informed our payment was not only due but the previous month was not paid and account was now delinquent. We immediately paid the bill and requested a bill actually be sent to us so auto-payments could be setup. The ensuing month 's bill ( XX/XX/XXXX ) arrived after the due date and again more late fees were applied. We called on this again and set the auto-payment to the billed amount. Later, we discovered GECRB also charged interest on the wrongly applied late fees and by that XX/XX/XXXX we paid an extra {$150.00} in more wrongly late fees. Auto-payments continued, however the interest on the wrongly applied late fees continued to build again with more errant late fees over the next 16 months resulting in GECRB ( now renamed Synchrony Bank ) demanding {$750.00} in late fees. Only this time, Synchrony Bank wrongly reported the account delinquent with the Credit Bureaus thus dropping the credit scoring. Despite evidence of all payments made and on time. We attempted to work with Synchrony Bank and submitted bank generated reports showing all payments with corresponding dates proving no late payments, however they have refused to remove the incorrect information to the Credit Bureaus or refund the over {$1000.00} in wrongly applied late fees & interest. Instead, Synchrony Bank responded by increasing the minimum payment due. We have disputed this with the Credit Bureaus only to find they consider themselves powerless when a Creditor chooses to send incorrect data to them. Synchrony Bank continues to refuse to make changes to the Credit Bureaus for this XXXX account. The Credit Bureaus have recognized a perfect credit history ( 20+ years ) and this one account is "" out of character '' due to the only one ever in negative status. When an explanation is provided, it matches with the "" expected '' behavior of someone with perfect credit.

After feeling uneasy about the situation, I called back again on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my refund was being requested, and the representative confirmed the request was placed. I asked again about a timeframe for the refund, and the new representative told me 150 days - up to a year. I asked them why it would take so long as other providers I've read are processing within 4-6 weeks and even within 2 weeks, in which they could not answer. I need the balance to be reinstated and a refund as soon as possible for forgiveness eligibility.

Struggling to repay your loan,"I obtained a student loan for my XXXX studies back from XXXX. Following graduation, I began repayment. In XXXX, I enrolled in graduate studies and obtained my XXXX XXXX in Secondary Education in XXXX. During my XXXX years of grad school, I deferred my student loans and began repayment after I graduated. I had difficulty paying the loan in the XXXX. I eventually applied for and received a forbearance. I then began repayment of my loans with a company that I can not recall the name of, and then the loan was passed along/purchased by different lenders without my knowledge until after the fact. For a time I did not even know to whom I should pay for the loan. In XXXX, ACS purchased the loan, and I have been paying them monthly, without fail, since that time ( though they were recently bought out by Conduent ). My loan interest rate was locked in at XXXX XXXX. I pay {$410.00} every month, and to date, I have paid {$36000.00} ( XXXX consecutive payments ) on a loan ( original loan amount being {$37000.00} ) that I now still owe {$44000.00} ( outstanding balance as of today ). I will admit that I have not checked my account often, as the payment comes out directly/electronically every month and has for almost XXXX years. I pulled up my account today and can not wrap my head around the outstanding balance. How can I owe this amount? I also do not see a projected loan payoff date on any of the screens that I researched while logged on to the website. Perhaps that is because at this rate, I will never pay it off. Something must be wrong here, and I fear that contacting the company without support will not get me anywhere, as I have read some very negative reviews about this new company, Conduent. I have no idea who to reach out to about this. I have found many resources online, but I am not sure which ones can be trusted or which ones are just other lenders or scammers. I found this resource, and I am making a plea for assistance, advice, information ... etc. Finally, when I clicked on the Website information for Conduent that is linked from my student loan account, I received a message indicating that the website I was trying access may be impersonating the company website to get access to my personal and financial information.

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"I have two issues. Issue # 1 is that their email billing is designed to cause you to incur late charges. They do n't send bills to your email until you are already overdue, and they have already charged you late fees. Apparently this is an issue with them, because they were legally compelled to send refunds of late fees last year. I 've had to request paper billing three times, and hopefully the girl I talked to today, XXXX, will actually follow through and make it happen. If they are going to make it so difficult to get onto paper billing, they should at least notify you of bills before they are overdue - it 's a total scam. 

Issue # 2 deals with my phone call with them today. I am currently unemployed. I called asking about forbearance. The gentleman I spoke with was not a XXXX XXXX speaker, which may have contributed to some confusion, but he lied to me and then attempted to enroll me into a monthly payment program without my knowing. 

When I asked about forbearance, he gave vague and conflicting information, telling me first that I had XXXX months total forbearance available, later telling me there was only XXXX months. Of course, it turns out there is up to XXXX months. 

He then told me that it would be better for me to pay the $ XXXX monthly payment in order to bring my account current, since forbearance would run out in XXXX anyway, and it would be better to retain the ability to use forbearance should I need to use it in the future. I agreed to making the payment now, and gave him my banking information. 

He then said he had to transfer me to an automated message which would explain the terms and conditions of the transaction, and that I should hit the # key after the message. As an aside, their message system has only the options to accept the terms and conditions or repeat the terms and conditions. What if you do n't accept, or got bad information ( like me ), and want to speak with the representative again? 

Eventually the system says that I had not hit a valid button within the time limit, and it transferred me back to the representative. Turns out that he was trying to enroll me into a monthly payment program, not take a one-time payment. I told him that was not what we had talked about and I was no longer comfortable dealing with him, then asked to be transferred to someone else. He kept trying to sell me, and I told him that I was not comfortable with him and that he could transfer me or I was going to call back and get someone else. He kept talking, and I told him I was not comfortable and hung up. 

After calling back, I got a girl named XXXX, and started the process over again. I got up to asking about forbearance, and she said she could enroll me in a program that would bring me current and yada yada yada, then paused, like someone was talking to her, then told me that, sure, she could arrange forbearance. She was helpful, and correctly informed me that private loans are subject to different conditions than federal loans, and explained that there is only XXXX months of forbearance available. She took my {$50.00} "" good faith '' payment and told me the next payment would be due in XXXX, but that I can arrange forbearance again at that time. She also assured me that she would personally make sure that I received paper billing from now on.",,1502253

Delinquent account,"I had a business relationship with the owner of XXXX XXXX, XXXXOn or about XX/XX/XXXX, Capital One Bank ( USA ) N.A . made a solicitation to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Upon verification and approval, on the front of the credit card, the words "" Capital One Business Platinum '' are printed as well as "" XXXX XXXX, L '' ( LC ). On the reverse side, the words "" Capital One Small Business Solutions Center '' also appear. ( Exhibit XXXX ). 
2. Capital One 's Customer Agreement specifically states that this is a business account. Under the heading Business Purpose Account : "" Your Account is a business Account that must be used only for business purposes. '' Capital One states under the Account Information clause that : "" We maintain the right to restrict or close your Account if your information can not be verified or you do not provide additional information as requested. '' Capital One accepted the application for a business credit account under these terms. In filling out the application, it required my name, address and social security number. I did not provide the EIN number nor did Capital One contact me to verify the information or request that I provide the EIN number. 
( Exhibit A ) 3. It is alleged that Capital One has misrepresented itself and committed credit card fraud by leading me to believe that by applying and receiving this business account, I had corporate status protection as a limited liability corporation. At certain times, Capital One issued and billed the account to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( Exhibits XXXX, XXXX ) 7. I filed legal action against officers of XXXX XXXX, XXXX in Federal Bankruptcy Court ( Exhibit XXXX ) and received judgment against officers of XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( Exhibit XXXX ). I continued making good faith payments after having been promised by XXXX XXXX, XXXX that they would reimburse me for business related expanse as well as all amounts owed. When it became clear that the owners of XXXX XXXX, XXXX were not going to reimburse me for business related expenses, I was no longer able to make good faith payments to Capital One and defaulted. 
8. Capital One has pursued this issue relentlessly. Capital One claims that I am personally responsible for the corporate account issued to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
9. Capital One filed a lawsuit on XX/XX/XXXX and continue putting pressure either settle or go to trial. I can not afford an attorney and continue to maintain that I have corporate status protection under a limited liability corporation. According to CAL. CORP. CODE 17101 : ... no member of a limited liability company shall be personally liable under any judgment of a court, or in any other manner, for any debt, obligation, or liability of the limited liability company, whether that liability or obligation arises in contract, tort, or otherwise, solely by reason of being a member of the limited liability company. 

10. Capital One has relentlessly pursued the collections, ignoring the fact that they issued a business card to an limited liability corporation, yet the individual is responsible for the debt.",,1554168

Delinquent account,"This complaint is against Capital One Credit Card negative account in my credit report. This negative account is hurting my credit, but makes a false claim. I do not owe Capital One any monies : Capital One was the first to brake the terms of the credit card agreement. In fact, Capital One has already taken this claim to court and the case was dismissed. Capital One claim is just wrong. 

Capital One broke the terms of the credit card when they deny my right to dispute a charge in my account. In 2010, I moved and was scamed by the moving company shiiping my stuff : in order to deliver my stuff, the merchant demanded a cash payment, when I had already paid for all merchant 's services with my credit card. Consequently, I disputed merchant 's charge on my Capital One credit card. However, Capital One denied my right, per the card 's terms and conditions, to dispute the charge. 

In order to deny my right to dispute the moving company 's charge, Capital One requested additional information ( which I had already provided in previous corresondence ) and only allowed me 24 hours to submit it, else Capital One would close the dispute. Capital One requested additional documents in a letter dated XXXX XXXX 2010. The letter was delivered on XXXX XXXX 2010 and it required the supporting documents to be received by XXXX XXXX 2010. Since I was out of the country ( as Capital One could have guessed from the charges in my credit card ), I did not find out about the 24 hours deadline to provide supporting documents, until it had expired. I was still able to submit the requested document within a week. However, Capital One disregarded my submission and closed the case. I filed a complaint argueing it was not reasonable I was only given 24 hours to reply Capital One 's request. I wanted Capital One to continue my dispute against the moving company. Capital One gave the excuse the time XXXX allows them to process the dispute was very short and to meet that timeframe they could only allow me 24 hours to reply their request for supporting material. This was all a lie by Capital one. I called XXXX and was told they do not set time limits to process disputes. in any case, I had filed my dispute less than 3 months after the credit card charge and my submission of suporting documents was less than 5 months after the credit card charge. Nevertheless, Capital One insisted to close the dispute, removed the temporary credit I had received and demanded I pay that charge. Since I considered Capital One had not respected my rights and had broken the terms of the credit card, by denying my right to dispute a charge, I informed Capital One I was not going to pay that charge and was not going to use my credit card ever again. Capital One very quickly added late fees and finance charges, until the balance reached around {$1500.00} and they charged the account off. 

Capital One continued demanding I pay the card 's balance in full. but I never agreed to Capital One 's claims. Eventually, Capital One realized that and decided to take its claim to court : the case was dismissed. So should now this negative account from my credit report, since Capital One 's claim is wrong. 

As a side note not relevant to this credit report dispute, I need to say it is really unfortunate, Capital One Dispute Department is the worst from all credit card companies I have ever dealt with. I had already had previous experiences where Capital One Dispute Department was very incompetent and unhelpful. I liked my Capital One credit card. It had good conditions and I used to use it a lot. I was a good client and was never late in my payments. However, I had to give it up as I found unacceptable Capital One would let me down : they denied my right to dispute an incorrect charge and so allowed some merchant to scam me.",,2175325

XX/XX/18, Citibank denied my request and provided a reason that I did not opened a saving account during their promotion period. ( See attachment # 3 ) Here is my complaint : 1. I opened Citi Priority Account Package with Regular checking and SAVINGS at same time. Citi 's application confirmation shows so. 

2. If I am NOT eligible to open the Savings account, should Citi send me any notice on this issue once their process is done? Why I have nerve receive any notification from Citibank since I applied to open a Citi Savings??

Problem with a company's investigation into an existing issue,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, California XXXX Date of Birth : XX/XX/XXXX SS # : XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding multiple violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) by creditors and the significant adverse impact it has had on my life. I kindly request your intervention to enforce my legal rights and seek the removal of unverified accounts from my credit report. 

Violations of the FCRA : Unauthorized Credit Inquiry by XXXX  : Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( B ) of the FCRA On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  conducted an unauthorized credit inquiry without my consent, violating Section 604 ( a ) ( 3 ) ( B ) of the FCRA. This unauthorized inquiry has had a lasting impact on my financial well-being. 
Personal Impact : Allow me to share the emotional toll these violations have taken on my life. The unauthorized inquiry by XXXX has been nothing short of devastating. I vividly remember that day as a turning point in my life. I had been diligently working to rebuild my credit and secure a brighter financial future for my family. That credit inquiry not only shook my financial stability but also took a toll on my mental and emotional well-being. 

In the wake of this unauthorized inquiry, my credit score plummeted, and I found it increasingly challenging to secure favorable terms for loans, mortgages, and even credit cards. It has caused undue stress and anxiety, affecting my sleep and overall quality of life. The dreams I had for my family, such as buying a home or financing my children 's education, have become distant and unattainable goals. 

Request for Resolution : I am kindly requesting the following actions : Enforcement of my legal rights under the FCRA against XXXX for the unauthorized credit inquiry. 
Immediate removal of the unauthorized inquiry and any associated negative marks from my credit report. 
I implore the CFPB to use its authority to ensure that creditors comply with the FCRA and respect consumers ' rights. The impact of these violations extends beyond mere financial inconvenience ; it has profoundly affected my life and my family 's future. 

I am ready and willing to provide any additional information or documentation required to support my case. I kindly request a thorough investigation and a timely resolution of this matter. 

Thank you for your attention to this serious issue. I look forward to a swift and just resolution that will help me regain control of my financial future and peace of mind.

Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,"I took out a short term installment loan with CashNetUsa to facilitate a small emergency. I In order to avoid excessive fees, I attempted to pay the loan off early, by debit card, the day before the first installment payment was due. I chose "" Pay off outstadning balance '' option and made the payment. However, their website is dilibertly decitful in making the customer think they paid off the then loan when in fact they didn't. The pay oustadnding balance ( which all consumers would agree means the total loan balance due ) is not the total loan balance due. They calculate the payment with the CAB fee, and do not include the full principal, so your actually left with one more payment PLUS interest PLUS another CAB fee, even though in the contract it specifically states that if you pay the loan off early you avoid other CAB fees. They are dilibertly misleading consumers by using the term "" Pay Off Outstading Balance '' so that conumsers think they are paying off the loan early and saving on the CAB fee, when in fact they have a small principal amout left, which will incur more interest and another CAB fee. For example, I took out an installment loan for {$800.00}. The day before the final payment, I choose "" Pay Off Outstading Balance Option '', and paid {$820.00}. When you make the payment, there is no breakdown on the screen that shows what portion is going toward Principal, Interest and CAB fee, its just one lump sum that is auto-populated by the system. After making the {$820.00} payment, my account still showed an ACH for {$150.00} due the next day. Thinking this was automaticly done by the system, I contacted CashNetUsa via their chat option, and requested the ACH be canccelled. They confirmed and cancelled the ACH. If I had not logged back into CashNetUsa, I would not have knonw that the account was not paid in full. Once I logged back onto the system, I saw the same amount of {$150.00} to be ACH drafted in two weeks. I contacted several different members via the chat option on the website to ask why I still owed a balance even though I picked "" Pay Off Outstadning Balance '' option and paid with a debit card the day before my first payment was due. All the customer associates I spoke with repeated that I still owed {$150.00} but would not tell me why I owed this amount, even though I picked "" Pay Off Outstanding Balance ''. Until I examied the reciept I recieved from email did I not realize that the "" Pay Off Outstading Balance Option '' did not include the full principal and none of the customer asstiance associates explained this as well.This is a flat out deceptive practice aimed at generating more interest and CAB fees from Users.",,3852682

( a ) IN GENERAL. -- Section 127 of the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1637 ) is amended by adding at the end the following : '' ( j ) PROHIBITION ON PENALTIES FOR ON-TIME PAYMENTS. -- '' ( 1 ) PROHIBITION ON DOUBLE-CYCLE BILLING AND PENALTIES FOR ON-TIME PAYMENTS. -- Except as provided in paragraph ( 2 ), a creditor may not impose any finance charge on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as a result of the loss of any time period provided by the creditor within which the obligor may repay any portion of the credit extended without incurring a finance charge, with respect to -- '' ( A ) any balances for days in billing cycles that precede the most recent billing cycle ; or '' ( B ) any balances or portions thereof in the current billing cycle that were repaid within such time period. '' ( 2 ) EXCEPTIONS. -- Paragraph ( 1 ) does not apply to -- '' ( A ) any adjustment to a finance charge as a result of the resolution of a dispute ; or H. R. 627 -- 5 '' ( 3 ) reduce the annual percentage rate previously increased when a reduction is indicated by the review ; and '' ( 4 ) in the event of an increase in the annual percentage rate, provide in the written notice required under section 127 ( i ) a statement of the reasons for the increase.

"Managing, opening, or closing account","I received a notice dated XXXX XXXX, 2015 stating that the PayCard program issued by Elan Financial Services and provided through Beacon Credit Union was being terminated ; stating that I would not be able to add funds after XXXX XXXX, 2015 ; and requesting I use all money on my card before XXXX XXXX, 2015, the close date. The notice also stated that barring any communication from me, any funds remaining on my card at the close date would be escheated. At the time, I had ~ {$2700.00} on the card. I immediately went to my credit union to withdraw the remaining funds. I was told that I could not withdraw more than {$1000.00} at one time, and that there was a cash withdrawal fee. I took the {$1000.00}, made a few purchases, and later withdrew another {$1000.00}. 

With my account now being under {$1000.00}, I went XX/XX/XXXX to withdraw the remaining {$490.00}. However, the expiration date on my card was XX/XX/XXXX and I had not received a replacement card so I was denied access to my money. Because I did not want any remaining funds on the card to be escheated, the credit union called the number on the card in my presence and then gave the phone to me. The Elan representative first told me that she could have a new card sent to me, but that it would not arrive in time for me to use it. BIG HELP. I asked how I was supposed to get my money. She said any balance on the account would be sent to me by check in XX/XX/XXXX. I specifically restated and verified that statement, mentioned the possibility of escheat per the notice, and expressed my desire to avoid it. The representative told me I would get the check and that the funds would only be escheated if I did not negotiate the check. 

XX/XX/XXXX arrived, and no check. So I called the number on my card again, and the Elan representative told me that the balance had been processed and I would receive a check within two weeks. Six weeks later, and no check. I called again, and was told that the funds had been escheated and was given the email address XXXXXXXXXXXX ' to find out how to claim my money.

Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"FACTS IN BRIEF : I took out a U.S. bank auto loan, dated XX/XX/XXXX, in the original loan amount of approximately {$11000.00} to purchase a used car ( attachment 1 ). The seller also had a U.S. Bank auto loan that was paid off with my new loan. Erroneously, the bank issued the title to the car to the seller, free and clear of all liens, instead of to me with the bank as the lienholder, therefore wiping out both their interest in the car and mine ( attachment 2 ). When I made the bank aware of their error, they did nothing to correct it. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me an email, asking me to bring them the title to the car so they could perfect their lien and protect their asset, even though they knew that they had issued the title to the seller ( attachment 3 ). The seller died within days of my discovering that the bank had erroneously issued her the title free and clear of all liens. I never took possession of the car because I could not get title to it and register it in my name and get insurance on it to protect my asset. 
FACTS IN DETAIL : I received the auto loan agreement in the mail in an envelope dated XX/XX/XXXX ( attachment 4 ). I did not know that the loan had closed until then, even though the loan is dated XX/XX/XXXX, an unreasonable twoXXXX month lapse. The seller had someone drive the car from California to my home in Arizona so I could register it here ; but when we went into the motor vehicle department, we were told that we did not have the necessary paperwork to register it. All that I had received in the envelope dated XXXX XXXX was a copy of the auto loan agreement in attachment 1.  We went into the bank and were told that the title would be coming in the mail to me in the next few weeks. Since I did not have title and could not register the car in my name or get insurance on it to protect my asset, as I said, I did not take possession of the vehicle. In XXXX, three months after the close of the loan, the free and clear title to the vehicle showed up in the sellers name and mailbox. I notified the bank of their error, and as I said they did nothing to correct it. The car was severely damaged while parked in the sellers driveway when a tree fell on it, caused by heavy winds during a major California fire that lasted from XXXX to XXXX. The seller died XX/XX/XXXX. As a lienholder on a loan banks always protect their security interest by requiring insurance on vehicles before they pass title to them ; but the bank did not do this because they made an error and passed title to the seller, free of all liens. 
The loan payments are current and are being automatically deducted from my U.S Bank account monthly in the amount of {$200.00}. I signed up for auto draft to get a reduced payment. I have several accounts at U.S Bank and if I close the account to try to stop them from deducting my payment, they can deduct it out of another account. My husband and I are XXXX XXXX XXXX, and therefore rely on our good credit rating. We have XXXX XXXX XXXX and their attorney at XXXX XXXX sent three demand letters to the bank asking them to rescind the note, refund my payments, and report to the credit agencies that the loan was paid as agreed and in full since they erroneously gave away both the banks interest in the vehicle and mine to a third party ( attachment 5 ). 

In response to the attorneys demand, the bank issued a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX,  stating that the transference of the title to the vehicle was the seller and buyers legal responsibility ( attachment 6 ). This would be the case if it were an unsecured loan. The loan agreement in attachment 1 clearly states that the vehicle, a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the SECURITY INTEREST FOR THE LOAN. This means that the bank should have been listed as the lienholder on the title. The bank was holding the title and erroneously issued it to the seller, free and clear of all liens. It was not the legal responsibility of the seller and buyer to establish the bank as the lienholder on the loan, secured by the car. It does not even make good business sense for a bank to shift the legal responsibility of transference of the title to the seller and buyer and entrust them to put the bank on title as the lienholder after they have paid out the funds on the loan. Furthermore, the bank is legally responsible to issue me free and clear title once I pay off the loan, secured by the vehicle, which they will not be able to do. 
After I received this letter from the bank, XXXX sent me to an outside attorney since they will only represent me as a defendant in a case. The outside attorney sent two letters and made several phone calls, requesting someone at the bank contact him ( attachment 7 ). No one at the bank has contacted him and he is now asking for {$10000.00} to enter into a lawsuit on a loan with an original loan balance of approximately {$11000.00} ( attachment 8 ). Bank attorneys know that no one can afford {$10000.00} in attorneys fees to fight an {$11000.00} loan. So even though they are well aware at this point of their error, they do not have to respond or resolve it. They just keep deducting the payments from my account. 
We finally had to purchase another car. Coincidentally, our new auto loan was placed with U.S. Bank. However, on this loan the bank is holding the title to the car until the loan is paid in full. They did not erroneous issue it to the seller, free of all liens, relying on the seller to transfer it to us and put the bank on the title as the lienholder after the funds were released. Additionally, the bank required us to have insurance so their asset was protected from loss. Banking rules, regulations and procedures are supposed to be the same by law for all customers. The banks error has put me in a financial hardship, trapped in debt with a loan secured by a vehicle that was damaged and that they gave away to a third party. Their error has me paying on a car that I can never own and would not want to own at this point. 
U.S. Bank touts as their registered trademark on their online banking site and in the signage in their banks : Were proud to be named a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not know what group gave them this name ; they do not say ; but if I knew, I would send them a copy of my complaint. The bank is certainly not being ethical in dealing with me.

I am desperate and have exhausted all of my limited resources and am seeking immediate relief and your help to resolve the financial entrapment the bank has me in. Can you help me please? Thank you.

Struggling to repay your loan,In XXXX all my loans were current as of today XX/XX/XXXX I show two of my loans are past due. I received no mail or email or phone correspondent saying that my loans were past due. When I called them today they said they've been having some issues with their system so it may have not updated but they now are wanting double payments. These loans have been in non-payment status because I have been in school so I did not even receive anything in the mail saying that these loans would be due again. I can not afford {$1000.00} in loan payments. The only thing they are willing to offer me is forbearance which really does not help the situation. This issue is in regards to the following loans : XXXX XXXX XXXX,,5290359
Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,"On XXXX. XXXX, 2023 I received an email from Explore Credit saying I was approved for {$1000.00}. I ignored it as spam as I get those a lot and know to never click links. Then I started getting voice mails and text messages ; also not uncommon. When they didn't stop I copied the URL to the website and using their log-in instructions, found a loan document in my name, complete with old bank account information -- the bank account is still active but I barely use it and haven't in years because the nearest branch is over XXXX hours away from me. I never applied for a loan with this company. I scrolled through the application and saw it was a payday company. I never signed. Then I started getting messages to verify my bank account so they could see my balances by linking them to it electronically. I NEVER do that except with reputable companies, government agencies or other banks. I closed the website and ignored it all. 

The next day ( XXXX. XXXX ) I got another email saying to check my bank account. I ignored it. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I got a overdraw notice from my bank. I checked my account and they had tried to withdraw a payment for {$300.00} and change. I didn't have that in my account so my bank refused but charged me {$24.00}. I immediately emailed customer service ( at the email I provided in this complaint ) and was told that I applied for a loan. I said I did not. The next response they admitted I hadn't : "" you're right you didn't apply with us but we got your information. '' How is that okay? They just somehow hacked my personal information, put it in a loan application and somehow got access to my bank account? 

Then, they said that I did "" e-sign '' the application and sent me a copy, with my electronic "" signature '' on XXXX. XXXX. I did not sign anything, I just scrolled through portions of the document, not even the entire thing. 

Since they, I have repeatedly asked them to quit attempting withdrawals, told them they had no authorization or consent. They kept repeating that an email with that request in writing wasn't "" acceptable '' as part of their process. That is not my understanding of the law. I have very poor cell phone service out where I live and I was not going to call someone I never initiated contact with in the first place and that was likely scamming me. I also reminded them that I never did any electronic or online bank verification process. Then they later told me ( again, via email ) they'd only stop withdrawal attempts if I sent them 3 months of bank statements. I told them I wasn't going to send bank statements to a random individual from an organization I'd never heard of before. 

So far they have tried to withdraw payments 8 times, resulting in over {$200.00} in overdraft fees TO ME. I've put in a fraud complaint to my bank but they said they may not be able to do anything since they had my bank account info, that it was easier for them to do if it was through the debit card -- which doesn't make sense to me. 

Right now I don't know what to do except close this bank account, which I've had for over 10 years and don't want to do, especially since I'll have to make up the over {$200.00} in overdraft fees Explore Credit has caused. 

I am attaching the "" loan agreement '' they sent me that they said I signed- all it has is a typed name on the bottom ; I never signed anything, and it even says at the top of the document that underwriting needs to verify and approve everything - I did not connect my bank to them for verification which in a separate email to me they said was required.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"I am refiling a claim due to lack of response to my dispute to the credit card company 's response and lack of response on XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

However, I never received any acknowledgement from the credit card company, and it has been nearly XXXX month since I submitted my dispute. I was paying {$8.00} a month for credit protection, i.e. XXXX, through the credit card company. XXXX NEVER notified me of suspicious or unusual activity on my credit card. 
Regarding me disputing the charge that posted on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and denying the XXXX fraudulent charges, I had called in and found the charge for XXXX charge pending. This is evident by me receiving conditional credit for the disputed item on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and the actual charge not posting until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. When I learned that it was an XXXX web site, I had reported the charge as fraud. Being XXXX I have no use for a site such as this and was extremely embarrassed to even have to speak to a representative regarding this charge. I had no knowledge that the XXXX charges to follow took place a few days later.

Request the credit card slip that shows the signature of the purchaser because my credit card said "" Check ID '' on the signature line.

Please find attached a receipt for a furniture purchase delivered to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX which is XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, on a third credit card that this individual stole. Unfortunately XXXX XXXX Furnishings no longer exists. However, XXXX XXXX is within XXXX mile of where XXXX was located.

Lastly, as for the balance being paid in full, I was attempting to keep my account in good standing and was going through many personal and medical issues at the time and did not keep close watch on my personal business.

Struggling to repay your loan,"Hello, Once again I am sending another complaint against Navient as far as their ridiculous monthly payment and their broken promises as far as repayment options. I attached as much information below to see if you can look into this matter ; If you looked at the previous complaints, it will help fill in the blanks to my issues and concerns.

I had recently called you not too long ago to look into a case in which was said it was duplicate ; after helpful agent reviewed and saw that my recent complaint was not a duplicate due that I had added more details on my complaint against Navient ; Navient continues to send monthly payments in 4 different loans with amounts starting from {$200.00} and up to almost {$1300.00} a month. I had called them on number of occasions to resolve this matter and all they have is excuses and repayment options in which I had already tried, no success, and they lied - instead of lowering the payments, they raised the interest rates and within 3 months attempt to raise the payment higher as soon as one agree to the terms. I got fed up with their lies, no one to turn to for help only from the Pennsylvania Attorney General in which they filed a huge Lawsuit against Navient, also wrote to Congress and to the White House - no response from them. Navient has cheated my mother on her co-signing payments in which they told her that she only had 2 loans under her name in which I finished paying one of the private loans due that they XXXX up the accounts ; instead of me paying for my private loans - I was paying the co-signers, brought this to Navient attention and they said that they would fix it but more lies and lack of support from their dept. My mother continues to pay for the other loan but Navient has added more to her in which they lied to her on the phone 2 times that there would be no more loans for her to pay once she finishes paying the final one she is currently paying as much as they also lied to her from making payment arrangements to lower her payments 4 times, every time it got higher and higher. I at this point is unable to continue paying my loans due that I am on a low-minimum wage job just recent and was out of work for almost a year due that employment is hard to come by here in Canada. I do not qualify for government assistance, unemployment, or welfare here due that I am only a permanent resident. My wife can not help me due that her monthly gross income is less than {$1000.00} a month, we can barely make ends meet especially our rent in which we will be homeless by end of XXXX  2018 ; I had made many attempts to find help for many years and all I gotten were run-arounds. I have proof that I and my mother in XXXX  are being cheated by Navient on how they scam and deceive consumers on loans and repayment options that does not work, in fact, that is one of the reasons why Navient is being sued for taking advantage of borrowers like myself and many others who are struggling and frustrated on what Navient is doing. I never got a feedback or response from Navient since day one of my complaint against them during and after I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX when they were located in XXXX, Pa. before moving to XXXX, Pa. / I had argued with the school before graduating due to the lack of education, had me sign papers that they would credit or deduct a percentage of my loans during the quarter semester but that was a lie, found out later that they had me sign for a credit loan in which I find that illegal to deceive students and promising them that if grades were at A or B level that we would be credited and all we had to do was sign. Further more I was told that if I continue to attend that they would promise me a job placement that never happened, that my age would not affect my qualifications to go into law enforcement in which I questioned them with concern, they also lied. I had already sent many complaints against them, I have emails proofing on my situation against the school, Navient ( The number of times I sent my complaints and concerns to them - By Letter, Fax, as well. ) I have no way to copy and paste All of my proof and vidal information to help you look into deeply on my serious complaints against Navient and if you should need the information, please feel free to email me or send to my mothers address in Philadelphia. I also had sent many forms for Loan Forgiveness and filled out a form to release my mother from co-signer ; I was simply ignored from Navient as well gotten run-arounds. I am hoping that you can help me and see if there's a case I can file against Navient on the number of times I had filed already from a number of Depts.

Identity theft / Fraud / Embezzlement,"Dear Sir/Madam, JPMorgan Chase credit card is holding me responsible for the for the fraudulent charges. 
I really do not understand that why bank 's fraud department is holding me responsible for these charges and how come do they expect me to pay {$39000.00} which I never used and I should not be responsible for these charges. 


There is a clear evidence that these charges are fraudulent 1. Signature does not match on the sales draft from merchant. 
2. Why bank did approve large transaction for XXXX USD without any authorization from customer when transaction occurred outside USA? 
3. Bank 's fraud department must notify me either by email/phone/text for such a large transaction. I have not received any indication for these charges. I come to know when I checked my statement online after arriving to the USA. 
4. Do you think merchant should do their due diligence? they should check address on the driving license ( see attached ) when they are selling product. 
5. This is not my normal spending habit since I opened the card since 2011 6. Why chase credit card did not send any text alerts/email for such a large transaction? 
7. Why bank is not holding merchant responsible for these fraudulent charges? Merchant should check when he is selling {$220000.00} goods to the consumer. 
8. Fraud department had enough evidence which does confirm that I did not make these transactions. However, Chase bank is still holding me responsible for these fraudulent charges? Why?",,2008251

Payoff process,"Hi, I made a payment to my credit card in the amount of {$3700.00} and an other of {$100.00} ( the full statement balance ). These payments were made on Friday XXXX XXXX 2016. My husband two hours later made a payment of {$240.00} to his credit card ( the full statement balance ). All payments were paid by my external XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on Monday XXXX XXXX 2016. My husbands credit card was paid and the balance currently is showing {$0.00} and a full credit line. However, my credit card is reflecting {$67.00} available credit, this even after being charged {$51.00} in interest. 

Today I had my husband call Capital One to find out why his Capital One account would have money applied accurately and timely and mine was not. He spoke with a "" Supervisor XXXX '' who 's Agent ID was identified as XXXX. She indicated that she did not know why, but that Capital One 's policy is that they can hold money for four ( 4 ) days. XXXX could not identify what indicators would trigger this business practice. XXXX also indicated that Capital One has reported to the Credit Bureaus that my current balance is {$180.00}. My husband voiced his concerns that this policy is an unfair and deceptive business practice when applied arbitrarily without rhythm or reason nor justification. My account has never been paid late, considered a slow pay account or otherwise given any trigger that I am not an honest, credit worthy, credit responsible customer. XXXX 's response was she was following Capital One policy ; or politely saying she did n't care nor does Capital One! 

My concerns are, Capital One holding funds, then charging interest though the statement balance was paid in full, is not only unfair but deceptive. Capital One reporting to the credit bureaus that payments were made in the amount of {$3800.00} but an available credit of {$51.00} could impact my debt to income ratio and lead to potential lenders in their underwriting processing questioning my credit worthiness. This is not only deceptive but unfair. Is this because I am female and do not make the income of my spouse or my male counterparts at Capital One? Do they enforce these same practices with their own employees or executives? They did not with my husband! Last, when asked to speak to XXXX 's supervisor or to someone on Capital One 's Corporate Escalation Team, she refused. XXXX 's actions demonstrated that she did not care about my issues or in resolving my concerns. I 'm very disappointed with Capital One and their poor customer service.

Opening an account,"I have opened an online XXXX  account  on XX/XX/2021 after being informed by a retail relationship banker at the Bmo Harris Bank fishers location on XXXX XXXX of a {$400.00} dollars sign on bonus for opening a XXXX  checking account. I have made qualified direct deposits and maintained over XXXX dollars in my checking account to qualify for the {$400.00} sign-on bonus ; however, as of XX/XX/2021, I still have not received the {$400.00} sign-on bonus. 

On XX/XX/2021, I wrote the XXXX XXXX XXXX an email requesting an explanation for the missing sign-on bonus. In which the banker explained that the missing sign-on bonus was due to not having a promo code associated with my account according to BMO Harris support team and online department. Which I explained that the promotion code was auto generated after clicking open XXXX  account on the website. The process did not provide the customer a copy of the promotional code via email therefore I dont have any record of the code. The banker then proceeded to tell me that the only way to resolve this issue is to have this unique promotion code so she will work on getting a hold of that code as of XX/XX/2021. I emailed the XXXX XXXX XXXX back on XX/XX/2021 requesting an update on the progress for locating that code and inquired if she can resolve the problem with more time, which she completely diverted addressing my question. She did inform me again in the reply that she can only resolve the issue if she has the unique promotion code. 

Since XX/XX/2021, there has been neither any email communication from this XXXX XXXX XXXX to address the missing code nor any attempt from the institution to contact me to ratify the situation.",,5020137
Struggling to pay mortgage,"REASON FOR MY COMPLAINT : Misapplied Federal Housing Administration guidelines in denying my request and opposing my inclusion for the XXXX recovery state assistance option. 

I applied for the XXXX program with the state in XX/XX/XXXX. A representative from the state notified Mr. Cooper of my approval XX/XX/XXXX and Mr. Cooper erroneously opposed my participation XX/XX/XXXX. 

As a result, I received a letter from the state XXXX stating : "" Your mortgage servicer has objected to your inclusion into the program ''. 

I have several recorded and noted conversations with Mr. Cooper which confirm that Mr. Cooper had NO reason to oppose my acceptance into the XXXX program. SEVERAL representatives of Mr. Cooper stated that their HARDEST HIT FUND DEPT. received the inclusion/approval letter from the state and sent the denial/objection letter to the state of NJ/ERMA. I have also received a letter XX/XX/XXXX from Mr. Cooper affirming THEIR ERROR. However, in the same letter they erroneously stated that they/ Mr. Cooper do not determine the ERMA/State 's decision which is 100 % False as my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX letter from ERMA CLEARLY STATES as follows : Your MORTGAGE SERVICER has objected to your inclusion into the program. 

I trusted Mr. Cooper when they said they would try to resolve THEIR Error when they erroneously objected my inclusion into the XXXX. I also appealed the XXXX  denial letter with confidence Mr. Cooper would resolve the issue THEY created which now caused me to become delinquent on my mortgage due to loss of employment AND the understanding that I would be receiving XXXX funding because of being included in the program. To my heartbreaking disappointment, I was again deceived by Mr. Cooper. I received another letter from the state ( XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX which said as follows : After careful review of XXXX our decision is as follows : Your MORTGAGE SERVICER has objected to your inclusion into the program. 

I am unable to reapply to the XXXX program that I initially applied for in XX/XX/XXXX as I am still with the same MORTGAGE SERVICER. 

I previously submitted a complaint. Mr. Cooper 's response was NOT Accurate as their response states that they received an initial letter from NJ XXXX in XXXX, see my attached letters. XXXX XXXX received the confirm of my inclusion to the XXXX program in XXXX resulting in an XX/XX/XXXX denial letter from XXXX stating : Your mortgage servicer has objected to your inclusion into the program Mr. Cooper 's response was untrue as there are SEVERAL calls and notes confirming MY attempts to rectify THEIR MISTAKE. 

In closing : Mr. Cooper 's unfair Mortgage practice and errors have caused me financial risk and undue stress. I am seeking legal assistance at this time as I don't want any other customer to endure what I have experienced. 

This whole ordeal have been pain staking to me a single mother and my 3 children. 

I am requesting support from the CFPB as I believe Mr. Cooper 's actions towards me are an abomination.

Fees or interest,"Starting with my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I wrote a check to US Bank to balance transfer {$1800.00} that was supposed to get me 0 % interest until XX/XX/XXXX. I did another check balance transfer on the same card with my XX/XX/XXXX statement for {$1800.00} that again was supposed to be 0 % interest unto XX/XX/XXXX. On my XX/XX/XXXX statement, I made a car payment to my wife 's car and it somehow counted as a cash advance in the amount of {$580.00}. The cash advance rate on this card is 25.99 %. My minimum payment on this statement was {$70.00} and I made payments that totaled {$1500.00} for this month and I was charged interest on the cash advance and on the purchases that totaled around {$23.00}. 

On my XXXX statement, I made a lot of purchases ( 16.99 % interest ), but also made a payment in the amount of {$4800.00} ( minimum payment was {$56.00} ) and was charged {$8.00} in interest on the cash advance that still somehow had a balance. 

On my XXXX statement, I made more purchases, but also paid {$1200.00} in payments with a {$120.00} minimum payment. One of my 0 % balance transfers was paid off by this month and I was charged {$66.00} in interest on my purchases ( 16.74 % interest now ) and {$.00} on the cash advance that was still not paid off, but now has a balance under {$10.00}. 

On my XXXX statement, I made more purchases and made payments of {$4500.00} ( minimum payment of {$100.00} ). This month, my other 0 % balance transfer was paid off, the cash advance still was not paid off and I was charged {$.00} in interest on the cash advance and {$67.00} in interest on purchases. 

It was with this last statement that I finally realized that they were paying off my lowest interest balances first and sticking me with the interest on my highest balances. It was my understanding that the Credit Card Act of 2009 made it the law that companies had to apply any "" overpayment '' ( anything paid above the minimum payment ) to my highest interest balances first and pay those off before moving to the next highest interest. When I called US Bank and asked them about it, they said the law changed and they were not required to do anything of the sort. They could apply my money how they see fit and have been applying my entire payment to the lowest interest balances, which is why my 0 % interest balances were paid off before the 25 % cash advance was paid off ( still not paid off technically ).

If they're right, let me know if the law changed or how I'm interpreting this wrong. But I couldn't find anything that said that info was correct and it appears they're breaking the law by doing this to me. Let me know though! Beyond that, if they're doing this to me, they're doing it to their other customers too!",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,3461080

Dealing with my lender or servicer,"XXXX XXXX, 2016 To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to request that the 60-day delinquency to XXXX student loan be changed ( I am the cosigner on the loan ). The account number is XXXX, and the loan is currently in a forbearance status. It was certainly delinquent, that I am not disputing. What I am disputing is the way to which this account has been handled, and the constant mixed messages my daughter and I have been receiving on the account dating back several months. 
Back in XXXX ( approximately XXXX/XXXX/16 ), my daughter made payment arrangements for the loan. On XXXX XXXX, she realized that her financial situation had not improved enough for her to be able to make a payment. She spoke to someone at AES who told her that she would be eligible for a repayment plan the details were as follows : Beginning on XXXX XXXX, 2016, for twelve months she would be making half payments of approximately {$60.00}. 
Without realizing that she was making payment arrangements on the same day, I made an online payment for the XXXX bill. When she told me she had made the payment arrangements and the arrangement she had just made pulled the loan out of default, she suggested that I should call to see if the payment could be cancelled. Shortly after speaking to my daughter, I called and spoke to a representative from AES who reviewed the notes, said that he could see this new payment arrangement, and that I could go ahead and cancel this payment. Based on information from this representative who clearly seemed to know what he was talking about, I cancelled this payment. 
On or about XXXX XXXX, 2016, I received a phone call advising that the loan was still delinquent. Neither XXXX of us received any official notice that the program my daughter entered into earlier in the month was not approved. Once I received this information, I spoke to the representative about her options. At this point, I am very concerned that the loan is coming close to 60 days delinquent. Had I known that the payment plan my daughter had entered into could have been denied, I would NEVER have cancelled the payment that I made on XXXX XXXX, 2016. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, my daughter made new payment arrangements, her and I both called on the XXXX to give my payment information. At this point, the loan was not even 50 days delinquent. I was assured that this was not going to be reported as 60-days delinquent, since the payment was made before that 60th day. It took an additional nine days for this payment to process and the deferment to be in place, and now this has been reported to my credit report as 60-days delinquent. I do not believe it ever was actually 60-days delinquent. 
My point is this, my daughter and I both communicated and THOUGHT we had made arrangements for this loan to be brought out of default long before it became 60 days delinquent. When XXXX calls in to speak to a representative, I believe it is imperative that the information we are given is true and accurate, this has not been the case for the past few times that we have spoken to representatives. 
The report of 60 days delinquent has caused my credit score to drop by more than XXXX points. As I am sure you can imagine, this is frustrating for me. I certainly understand that the debt was past due, however, my daughter and I both communicated regularly with AES and assumed that the information we had been provided was accurate, so everything was going to be "" OK. '' Given all of this confusion, I have XXXX requests. First, please remove the 60-days delinquent notice from my and my daughter 's credit reports. Secondly, given these same issues, I would appreciate it if someone could review the situation and allow my name to be removed from the student loans that I have co-signed for XXXX XXXX. 
Your consideration and prompt response on this important matter is certainly appreciated.",,1828165

Getting a credit card,"I am writing to bring to your attention a concerning situation involving my application for an American Express XXXX Card. Despite successfully applying for the card, I never received confirmation of approval or the actual card itself. Subsequently, unauthorized usage occurred on the card, resulting in fraudulent charges and an account that was sent to collections. 

Here is a concise summary of the events : Application : I applied for the American Express XXXX Card through the designated application process. While I received an acknowledgment of my application submission, I never received any further communication confirming approval or the mailing of the card. 

Unauthorized Usage : To my surprise, I discovered that unauthorized transactions were being made on the American Express XXXX Card, indicating that the card had been issued and was being used without my knowledge or consent. This raised serious concerns about the security of my personal information.

Card Theft : It became evident that the card had been mailed out to an incorrect address. Unfortunately, the card fell into the wrong hands, and an unknown individual stole the card to initiate unauthorized transactions.

Account Closure : Once I became aware of the unauthorized activity, I immediately contacted American Express to report the fraudulent charges and the unauthorized usage of the card. The account was subsequently closed to prevent any further misuse. 

Collections and Damage : Despite taking swift action to report the unauthorized usage and close the account, I was informed that the account had been sent to collections due to outstanding charges that had accumulated as a result of the fraudulent transactions. The total amount sent to collections is {$1400.00}. 

Ineffective XXXX XXXX : The card 's issuance to the wrong address, coupled with the subsequent unauthorized usage, underscores a severe breakdown in the card delivery and security processes. 

This situation has caused significant distress, financial burden, and damage to my credit. I am seeking your assistance in resolving this matter promptly. I believe that the circumstances surrounding the unauthorized usage of the American Express XXXX Card are a result of systemic vulnerabilities in the card issuance and delivery processes, which require a thorough investigation to prevent similar incidents from happening to other consumers. 

I kindly request that you investigate this matter and work with American Express to rectify the situation, including the removal of the erroneous charges from collections, restoring my credit standing, and addressing the security gaps that allowed this situation to occur. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution and appreciate your efforts in safeguarding consumers ' financial well-being.",,7457917

Payoff process,"I went to pay my Amex. It showed I only owed a small amount. However the amount of the bill was over XXXX. I paid the total which over XXXX. I then went and looked at the upcoming closing bill, and realized there were over XXXX in credits on the bill that yet to close. I immediately realized it was applying the credits to the already closed bill. I went in and hit "" cancel payment ' for the XXXX. And then paid the minimum of XXXX some odd dollars. The reason being is that if I had not done that, Amex system will automatically take that overage of XXXX and apply to s pay over time portion of my card, shock I did NOT want or authorize. 

The cancel showed in the screen with XXXX pending processing. This was within 20 minutes of the initial transaction. I then receive XXXX emails hours later saying XXXX PAYMENTS were processed. This is unacceptable for XXXX. I then decided to wait a few days to let the next statement close and call if needed. I called and the representative basically said too bad. This is unethical as I as the cardholder and customer should have the right to determine where my payment/money is applied as long as any minimums are met. It should not be up to a system and as well system errors. 

I asked for a supervisor ( and had to fight to get XXXX ). 

A supervisor came on and edit idly told me the same. I pointed out it was obvious what I had done as why would I pay XXXX and then XXXX.? She argued but in the end found a way to put a XXXX charge from my current stating to the pay over time to help even things out. I accepted this as a temporary measure. But am not satisfied as now that sticks with interest and XXXX higher balance on the pay over time portion. 

This is unethical and should be illegal for a card network to force you to allow their erroneous payment system to make decisions for me as a consumer. This is my money and I did NOT AUTHORIZE the application of funds to the pay over time, and the Amex 'cancel ' payment option did not work. ( Even though it showed as cancelled and then disappeared ). 

This is an injustice and I was n't treated well during the process. The Amex system has issues, thus happened in the past and the XXXX was x led to reapply the funds and were apologetic. I feel swindled and find this on the verge of being illegal. I am losing money by the XXXX charge being put into the pay over time.

I sent the attached letter and spreadsheet and have heard nothing since then.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,1660330
Dealing with my lender or servicer,"As a result of this error, I have 9 late individual marks against my credit score. They only sent one letter for the loan, not 9 notifications for each loan. At the time I was unemployed. If they are marking 9 late payments they should be required to send 9 separate notifications. They do not notify customers that they will have separate negative marks on credit if they do not pay the "" one '' bill on time. 
The result of these 9 late marks on my credit have made it very difficult to qualify for housing, utilities, and access to credit. I am enrolled in auto payment and able to pay my loans. 

I was marked late for student loans while enrolled in XXXX. They refused to updated because they need a form from university, previously the university sent a form but since it is not official form, did not have enrollment status, it had the classes I was enrolled in for each semester. I offed to provide them the tax form from the Department of the Treasury ( Internal Revenue Service ) according the the university tells them I am enrolled at least part time for the year. I also offered to provide them my grades. 
Navient makes it extremely difficult for customers to get issue fixed. They email you a form to give to the university to send, but the email does not come for another hours. Then the university requires you to sign a form to let them fill out the form. 
It is a hardship because it requires me to have a printer, scanner and travel to the school to explain what they need to send. Navient offers no good will for people only trying to fix credit, they do not care about customers.",,2264830

Late fee,"Bank of America experienced failure in their auto-pay system. However, I was charged late payments, interest, and potentially other adverse affects.= This failure occurred a month ago. My auto-debit was enrolled for over a year. Auto-payment was adjusted to minimum payment. Minimum payment would have still counted as a payment. However, no auto-debit occurred. The bank account that was linked, has plenty of funds -I can prove that. 

When I was notified that i had "" missed '' a payment because their auto-payment did not deduct, I used the make payment button on the home screen. According to the person I talk to day named XXXX, this applied a payment to the wrong account. 

My credit score is in the high XXXX and my credit report has no missed payments. I have also not had a missed payment with Bank of America since I opened the account in 2010. I have relationshiips with all XXXX of the major credit card companies and I can say without a doubt that my experience with Bank of America has been the worst of late. I have been transferred mid sentence and dropped. I hope that this is only a one time event and can be resolved in the future so that BOA can retain my business.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,1983507
Lost or stolen check,"I opened two business accounts back in XXXX of XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was formed XX/XX/XXXX. Both accounts were closed out, one was closed at the end of XXXX and the other was closed out at the beginning of XXXX. I was informed I would receive both remaining balances in the form of a cashiers check. However I waited and called in from the middle of XXXX till now about this issue. They finally did send one check out after doing a claim that check was sent XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$18000.00}. The other check in the amount of {$18000.00} hasnt been sent out I was informed of another check separate from that in the amount of {$7700.00} that was supposed to be deposited on XX/XX/XXXX along with the second remaining balance cashiers check to my recent business account which was opened in XXXX of this year when I received the first cashiers check. The account was forced closed due to no activity since the first deposit made when the check was cashed upon opening the account. I have been treated rude when going to the branch and I have been treated rude when calling in I feel uncomfortable going to the bank now in behind the treatment received I was told twice I wouldnt get my money sent to me for no reason at all in a very unprofessional rude manner. The first time I was told this after being informed I would be sent my money back in XXXX and the second time now in XXXX I was told this once again after being informed I would receive my money. The same exact statement made again after them finally sending out my first check after the fact they stayed I wouldnt get it. I have been transferred from department to department and treated very unfairly when I have been nothing but respectful and nice even when I was treated the way I have been. Both of the checks have been verified by the claims department and are ready to be sent out as they have already been attempted to be deposited into the account that was recently forced closed on the same day the money was due to be deposited randomly but Bank of America account closure department redirects me back to claims instead of sending the money out. They are refusing to send my money as they did for the first check and after almost XXXX years I finally got just the first check sent back in XXXX of XXXX. I am still awaiting the last two checks after being promised by multiple employees I would be sent these checks this was even verified at the branch who treated me extremely unjust and unfair. My account was mysteriously forced closed on the same day I was supposed to have both of the checks deposited by Bank of America themselves. Why cant I get the checks resent? If they were already due to be deposited and show in the system they were deposited into the forced closed account on XX/XX/XXXX confirmed by three employees already between account closure and claims.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,6210015
